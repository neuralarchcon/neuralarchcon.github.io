The proposer and chair of our Action â€“ Kristian Sandberg - has been interviewed for the COST media! Kristian has given a fascinating interview discussing Action aims and goals in the broader context of the current consciousness studies.

The theoretical background of our project, as well as the details of our experimental approach have been addressed. Learn why we collect DNA samples together with the MRI scans and how the machine learning will help us to analyse the data. Finally, as in case of all COST projects, the societal impact of the project realisation has been highlighted. As Kristian told: _We should keep in mind that modern society is a great beneficiary of modern science, which has made our lives healthier, longer, and happier. We hope our project will contribute to this goal._
