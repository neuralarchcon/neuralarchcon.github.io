The success of our Action stands on shoulders of the Action members. Let us introduce one of the key figures behind data collection endeavour â€“ Renate Rutiku.

Renate is a post-doc at the Institute of Psychology, Jagiellonian University, the host of the Krakow data collection site. She also serves as a co-leader of the Working Group 1: Neuroarchitectural mapping Group. Renate has prepared many of the procedures we are running in Krakow and she oversees the data collection on everyday bases.  
Renate has been recently interviewed by NAWA, the funding agency supporting her stay in Poland. The interview addressing, among other issues, her involvement in the COST project, is available [HERE](https://nawa.gov.pl/en/nawa/news/ulam-nawa-programme-a-unique-chance-to-do-your-own-research-project).
