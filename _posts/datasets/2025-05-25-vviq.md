{% include JB/setup %}

A psychological self-report tool used to measure how clearly and vividly a person can imagine visual scenes in their mind. Participants are asked to visualise specific scenarios and rate the vividness of their mental images on a 5-point scale, with lower scores indicating more vivid imagery. The VVIQ-2 is an updated version of the original VVIQ, offering slight modifications to improve reliability. It is widely used in research on mental imagery, memory, and individual differences in cognitive style.
  
  
### Instruction:
Visual imagery refers to the ability to visualize, that is the ability to form mental pictures, or to "see in the mind's eye". Marked individual differences have been found in the strength and clarity of reported visual imagery and these differences are of considerable psychological interest.  
The aim of this test is to determine the vividness of your visual imagery. The items of the test will possibly bring certain images to your mind.  
You are asked to rate the vividness of each image by reference to the 5-point scale given below.  
0 – No image at all  
1 – Vague and dim  
2 – Moderately clear and vivid  
3 – Reasonably clear and vivid  
4 – Perfectly clear & vivid as if I was actually seeing it  
So for example, if you are able to form a mental image, such that it's reasonably clear and vivid, drag the slider to the corresponding position.  
Before you turn to the items below, familiarize yourself with the different categories on the rating scale. Throughout the test, refer to the rating scale when judging the vividness of each image. Try to do each item separately, independent of how you may have done other times.  
Complete all items for images obtained with your eyes closed.  
In answering items 1 to 4, think of some relative or friend whom you frequently see and consider the picture that comes before your mind's eye.
