Observers viewed black and white two-tone images while their eye movements were recorded. Two-tone images are derived from photographs of natural scenes (“templates”). Each two-tone appears as meaningless patches on initial viewing. Once an observer has acquired relevant prior object knowledge by viewing the corresponding template, however, processes of perceptual organization in the visual system bind the patches of the two-tone image into a coherent percept of an object.

#### Detailed description: 
-	We used 30 pairs of images, where each pair consisted of a two-tone image and its template in grayscale. 
-	The main objects depicted in the images were either animals (25 images), humans (three images), or animals and humans (two images). 
-	The eye movements were recorded using an EyeLink 1000+ eye-tracker (with a 500 Hz sampling rate).
-	Images were presented centrally on the screen, against a mid-gray background. Images measured 21.9° of visual angle horizontally and 14.6° vertically.
-	The experiment consisted of 10 blocks; a single block is schematically illustrated in the figure above and described below. 
-	Each block started with the Before condition, in which three two tones were presented, each for 3 s. Observers were instructed to carefully look at these images, but they were not specifically told to search for objects. Two-tone images were preceded by a centrally located fixation dot displayed for 1 s. They were followed by a visual analog scale, which observers adjusted to indicate how meaningful they experienced the two-tone image to be.   After each rating, a blank screen was displayed for 500 ms. The Before condition was followed by the Template condition, in which template images were displayed while eye movements were recorded (again, each for 3 s, preceded by a fixation dot). After the Template condition, we ensured that observers had enough object knowledge to bind two-tone images into meaningful object percepts by presenting six cycles of dynamic blending between two tones and their templates (Blending Phase). After the Blending Phase, the After condition was presented, which was identical to the Before condition except that images were presented in a newly randomized order.
