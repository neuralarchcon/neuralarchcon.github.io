This dataset contains EEG and ECoG recordings from 20 participants performing an attention task. The data was collected at the University of Krakow and is available for download. More details about the dataset can be found in the [dataset documentation](https://example.com/dataset1). Every participant completed the task while their brain activity was recorded, providing a rich source of data for studying attention mechanisms. The dataset includes both raw and preprocessed data, along with annotations for events and conditions. It is suitable for various analyses, including time-frequency analysis, event-related potentials (ERPs), and machine learning applications.
