#### Detailed description

The IAMI was designed as a single scale measuring the overall frequency of future and past involuntary events, with clearly defined and closely matched future and past subscales.

**Response Scale**: Each of the 20 items is rated on the following scale:
- Never (0)
- Once a month or more (1)
- Once a week or more (2)
- Once a day or more (3)
- Once an hour or more (4)

The measure correlates with depression scales (CES-D), indicating relationships between involuntary memory frequency and emotional state.
