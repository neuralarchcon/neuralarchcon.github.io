Designed to measure the frequency of involuntary memories and future thoughts in everyday life. Involuntary memories and future thoughts both typically come to mind in response to identifiable cues and in situations with diffuse attention. In addition, they may be affected by recent salient personal events or current concerns.

#### Detailed description

The IAMI was designed as a single scale measuring the overall frequency of future and past involuntary events, with clearly defined and closely matched future and past subscales.

**Response Scale**: Each of the 20 items is rated on the following scale:
- Never (0)
- Once a month or more (1)
- Once a week or more (2)
- Once a day or more (3)
- Once an hour or more (4)

The measure correlates with depression scales (CES-D), indicating relationships between involuntary memory frequency and emotional state.
