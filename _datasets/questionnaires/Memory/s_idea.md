The IDEA permits the study of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of déjà vu experiences. A déjà vu experience is a dissociative phenomenon, which can be characterized as a subjectively inappropriate impression of familiarity of the present with an undefined past.

#### Detailed description

The questionnaire is a 23-item self-administered instrument consisting of:
- A general section of 9 questions
- A qualitative section of 14 questions comprising 48 topics

**Note**: In some sites (Krakow and Brno), only one item from the questionnaire is administered as part of the multisite wishlist.
