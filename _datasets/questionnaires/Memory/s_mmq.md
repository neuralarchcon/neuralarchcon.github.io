#### Detailed description

**Each of the three MMQ scales is scored and interpreted separately. Scores from the individual scales are not combined into a total score.**

**MMQ-Ability** (administered in this study): This scale measures self-perception of everyday memory ability. Respondents rate how often they experienced each of 20 common memory mistakes over the previous two weeks. The score range is 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating better self-reported memory ability.

**MMQ-Satisfaction** (administered in this study): This scale measures satisfaction, concern, and overall appraisal of one's own memory. Each of 18 statements is rated based on degree of agreement. The score range is 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating a higher degree of satisfaction. This subscale is useful for extracting the "self-report component" of memory assessment.

**MMQ-Strategy** (not administered): This scale measures the use of practical memory strategies and aids in day-to-day life. Respondents rate how often they used each of 19 memory strategies over the previous two weeks. The score range is 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating greater use of memory strategies.
