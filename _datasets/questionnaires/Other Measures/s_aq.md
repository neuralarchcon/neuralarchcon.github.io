A self-report measure of autistic traits in the general population. The AQ-Short is not a diagnostic instrument but rather assesses the distribution of autism-related characteristics across the population.

#### Detailed description

The AQ-Short comprises 28 items (compared to 50 in the full-scale version) and measures two higher-order factors:
1. **Social behavioral difficulties**
2. **Fascination for numbers/patterns**

**Response Scale**: Participants respond to each statement on a 4-point Likert scale:
- 1 = definitely agree
- 2 = slightly agree
- 3 = slightly disagree
- 4 = definitely disagree

**Scoring**:
- The scoring is reversed for items in which an "agree" response is characteristic for autism (24 out of 50 items in the full scale)
- Item scores are summed
- In the dichotomized version used in some studies, answer categories are collapsed into "agree"/"disagree" scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 50 (full scale) or 0 to 28 (short version)

**Interpretation**: The study suggests that a cut-off of >65 (on the full scale with 4-point scoring) may be useful for identifying clinically relevant levels of autistic traits.

**Data Quality**: If more than 10% of items are missing (>3 in the AQ-Short), the questionnaire is considered unreliable and data should be discarded.

The AQ has been shown to be a reliable instrument to quantify the autism phenotype and has been used in studies of cognitive, neural, genetic, and hormonal correlates of autistic traits.
