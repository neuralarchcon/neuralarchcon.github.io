#### Detailed description

The most plausible view is that cognitive failure makes a person vulnerable to showing bad effects of stress, rather than itself resulting from stress. High CFQ is a vulnerability factor making the individual less able to resist the effects of stress.

**Scoring**: Additive - items are summed to create a total score.

**Recent Development**: A recent exploratory factor analysis identified one dominant factor, which was supported by subsequent confirmatory factor analysis. A revised 15-item version (CFQ 2.0) has been proposed that demonstrated good test-retest reliability and explained variance in objective performance on attentional control tasks. Scores were associated with focusing, switching, cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and negative affect in ways consistent with the original CFQ.
