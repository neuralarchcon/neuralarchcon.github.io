#### Detailed description

The Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI) is a comprehensive self-report instrument designed to measure musical sophistication across multiple dimensions in both musicians and non-musicians. Unlike traditional measures that focus primarily on formal music training, the Gold-MSI captures a broader range of musical behaviors, skills, and engagement.

The measure was developed to address the need for a psychometrically sound, multi-dimensional assessment of musicality suitable for research with the general population, including individuals with no formal musical training.

Respondents rate statements about their musical behaviors, skills, and experiences on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "completely disagree" to "completely agree."

#### Five-Factor Structure

1. **Active Engagement**: Engagement with music through listening, concerts, and seeking out musical experiences
   - Frequency and variety of music listening
   - Attendance at live musical performances
   - Motivation to engage with music
   - Number of items: 9

2. **Perceptual Abilities**: Self-rated abilities in music perception and discrimination
   - Ability to identify and remember melodies
   - Discrimination of musical elements (pitch, rhythm, harmony)
   - Recognition of musical patterns
   - Number of items: 9

3. **Musical Training**: Amount and intensity of formal and informal music training
   - Years of instrumental/vocal training
   - Practice habits and commitment
   - Music theory knowledge
   - Number of items: 7

4. **Singing Abilities**: Self-rated singing skills and vocal production
   - Ability to sing in tune
   - Confidence in singing
   - Vocal control and expression
   - Number of items: 7

5. **Emotions**: Emotional responses to and uses of music
   - Emotional reactivity to music
   - Use of music for mood regulation
   - Emotional expressiveness through music
   - Number of items: 6

#### General Musical Sophistication Index

In addition to the five subscales, the Gold-MSI provides a **General Musical Sophistication score** calculated from 18 items that best represent overall musical sophistication. This general index can be used when a single composite measure is preferred.

#### Scoring

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate mean or sum of items for each of the five factors

**General Index**: Sum or average of the 18 designated general sophistication items

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater musical sophistication in each domain. The Gold-MSI allows for profiling of strengths and weaknesses across different aspects of musicality.

#### Psychometric Properties

The Gold-MSI demonstrates:
- Good to excellent internal consistency (α values ≥ .82 for subscales)
- Very good test-retest reliability (r values ≥ .84)
- Clear five-factor structure confirmed through factor analysis
- Convergent validity with objective music perception tests
- Cross-cultural validity across multiple languages and countries
- Appropriate for use across the full range of musical expertise

#### International Validations

The Gold-MSI has been successfully validated in numerous languages, including:
- Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, and others
- Demonstrates cross-cultural applicability and reliability
