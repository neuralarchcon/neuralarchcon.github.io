summary: A self-report measure assessing the tendency to rate oneself as better than average across various personality traits and abilities. Participants rate how personality trait words describe them compared to an average peer, typically using a sliding scale or Likert-type rating.

#### Detailed description

The Superiority Illusion (SI) measure assesses the "better-than-average effect," a well-documented cognitive bias in which individuals overestimate their own abilities and characteristics relative to others. This illusion of superiority represents a form of positive self-enhancement that is common across cultures and domains.

The measure typically involves presenting participants with a series of personality trait words or ability descriptors and asking them to rate how these traits describe them compared to an average peer or the general population.

**Administration**: Participants rate themselves on various traits using a scale (e.g., sliding scale or Likert-type rating) indicating whether they believe they possess more, less, or the same amount of each trait compared to the average person.

**Theoretical Background**: The superiority illusion has been linked to:
- Self-serving bias in attribution
- Metacognitive monitoring abilities
- Dopaminergic activity in resting-state brain networks
- Individual differences in optimism and self-esteem

#### Scoring

**Mean Superiority Score**: Typically calculated as the average across all trait ratings, with higher scores indicating a stronger tendency to view oneself as superior to others.

The superiority illusion shows individual differences and has been found to correlate with:
- Resting-state brain network connectivity
- Dopamine D1 receptor availability
- Metacognitive performance
- Optimism and positive affect
