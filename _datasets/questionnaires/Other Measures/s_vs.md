#### Detailed description

Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is a neurological condition characterized by continuous visual disturbances, primarily a perception of numerous small, flickering dots throughout the entire visual field that resemble television static or "snow." The Visual Snow Symptoms Questionnaire assesses the presence, severity, and impact of these symptoms.

**Note**: As of 2025, the Colorado Visual Snow Survey 2.0 (CVSS 2.0) represents the most recent validated patient-reported outcome measure specifically designed for VSS assessment. Earlier questionnaires and diagnostic criteria may vary across studies.

#### Core Diagnostic Criteria for Visual Snow Syndrome

According to consensus diagnostic criteria, VSS requires:

**1. Core Symptom (Required)**:
- Dynamic, continuous tiny dots (visual snow) across the entire visual field
- Present for more than 3 months
- Persisting regardless of lighting conditions

**2. Additional Visual Symptoms** (at least 2 of 4):
- **Palinopsia**: Persistence or recurrence of visual images after the stimulus is removed (afterimages, trailing)
- **Photophobia**: Enhanced sensitivity to light
- **Nyctalopia**: Impaired vision in low light conditions or excessive floaters
- **Blue field entoptic phenomenon**: Seeing small bright dots moving in the visual field, particularly against blue sky

#### Associated Symptoms Often Assessed

Beyond core criteria, VSS questionnaires may assess:

**Visual Symptoms**:
- Persistent afterimages (palinopsia)
- Enhanced blue field entoptic phenomenon
- Self-light of the eye (phosphenes)
- Spontaneous photopsia (flashes of light)
- Difficulty seeing in low light
- Excessive floaters

**Non-Visual Symptoms**:
- Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
- Migraine headaches
- Depersonalization/derealization
- Concentration difficulties
- Anxiety or depression related to symptoms

#### Scoring and Assessment

Visual snow questionnaires typically assess:
- **Presence/absence** of each symptom
- **Severity** of symptoms (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)
- **Frequency** of symptoms (constant vs. intermittent)
- **Impact on daily functioning** (quality of life, work, reading ability)
- **Age of onset** and symptom progression
- **Comorbid conditions** (especially migraine)

#### Differential Diagnosis

The questionnaire helps distinguish VSS from:
- Persistent migraine aura
- Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD)
- Ophthalmic conditions
- Other neurological disorders
