#### Detailed description

The Cortical Hyperexcitability Index-II (CHi-II) is a revised self-report measure designed to assess proxy markers of cortical hyperexcitability, particularly as manifested through visual perceptual experiences. Cortical hyperexcitability refers to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the cortex, which has been implicated in conditions such as migraine, visual snow syndrome, and photosensitive epilepsy.

The CHi-II was developed to provide a stable, reliable screening tool for identifying individuals who may experience symptoms associated with cortical hyperexcitability, particularly in visual cortex.

**Target Populations**: The CHi-II is particularly relevant for:
- Individuals with migraine (especially migraine with aura)
- Visual snow syndrome
- Photosensitive conditions
- Research on visual perception and cortical function

#### Three-Factor Structure

1. **Heightened Visual Sensitivity and Discomfort (HVSD)**
   - Discomfort or distress from visual patterns, bright lights, or high-contrast stimuli
   - Aversion to striped patterns, fluorescent lighting, or busy visual environments
   - Visual stress symptoms

2. **Aura-like Hallucinatory Experience (AHE)**
   - Experiences resembling migraine aura phenomena
   - Transient visual disturbances such as zigzag lines, blind spots, or shimmering lights
   - Brief hallucinatory-like visual experiences

3. **Distorted Visual Perception (DVP)**
   - Ongoing perceptual distortions in visual processing
   - Objects appearing to move, shimmer, or change appearance
   - Persistent visual aberrations

#### Scoring

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate separate scores for each of the three factors (HVSD, AHE, DVP)

**Total CHi-II Score**: Sum across all items to obtain an overall cortical hyperexcitability index

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater evidence of cortical hyperexcitability correlates. Research has shown that individuals with migraine, particularly migraine with aura, produce significantly elevated scores on both the AHE and HVSD factors compared to controls.

#### Clinical and Research Applications

The CHi-II has been used to:
- Screen for cortical hyperexcitability in clinical populations
- Identify individuals at risk for migraine and visual disturbances
- Investigate relationships between visual perception and neurological conditions
- Study individual differences in visual cortex function

#### Psychometric Properties

The CHi-II demonstrates:
- Stable 3-factor structure
- Good internal consistency for subscales
- Sensitivity to group differences (e.g., migraine vs. non-migraine)
- Construct validity with related measures of visual perception
