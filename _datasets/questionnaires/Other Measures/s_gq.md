#### Detailed description

The Gaming Questions (GQ) is a brief demographic and behavioral questionnaire designed to assess individuals' gaming habits, preferences, and engagement with video games. Unlike psychometric scales that measure psychological constructs, the GQ collects factual information about gaming behavior to characterize participants' gaming profiles.

This measure is particularly useful in research studies to:
- Categorize participants by gaming experience
- Describe gaming platforms and preferences
- Quantify gaming engagement (hours per week)
- Identify non-gamers and reasons for non-gaming

#### Questions Assessed

**1. Gamer Self-Identification** (GQ1)
- "How do you characterize yourself as a gamer?"
- Response options typically include: Non-gamer, Casual gamer, Regular gamer, Hardcore gamer, Professional gamer (or similar categories)

**2. Reasons for Not Gaming** (GQ1a)
- If respondent indicates they do not play video games, they list up to 3 reasons why
- Open-ended or categorical responses
- Examples: No interest, No time, Too expensive, Prefer other activities

**3. Gaming Platforms Used** (GQ1b_1 through GQ1b_11)
Respondents indicate which platforms they use for gaming:

**PC Platforms**:
- GQ1b_1: PC - Windows
- GQ1b_2: PC - Mac
- GQ1b_3: PC - Linux
- GQ1b_4: PC - Other

**Console Platforms**:
- GQ1b_5: Console - Xbox
- GQ1b_6: Console - Wii
- GQ1b_7: Console - PlayStation
- GQ1b_8: Console - Other

**Mobile/Tablet Platforms**:
- GQ1b_9: Mobile/tablet - Android
- GQ1b_10: Mobile/tablet - iPhone/iPad
- GQ1b_11: Mobile/tablet - Other

**4. Gaming Hours - Last Week** (GQ1c)
- "How many hours did you play video games last week?"
- Open numerical response

**5. Gaming Hours - Typical Week** (GQ1d)
- "How many hours do you generally play video games a week?"
- Open numerical response
- Provides a more stable estimate of typical gaming engagement

#### Scoring and Interpretation

The Gaming Questions are primarily descriptive rather than psychometric:

**Gaming Classification**: Based on self-report (GQ1) and/or hours played
- Non-gamer: 0 hours per week or self-identifies as non-gamer
- Casual gamer: Low hours (e.g., <5-10 hours/week)
- Regular gamer: Moderate hours (e.g., 10-20 hours/week)
- Heavy/Hardcore gamer: High hours (e.g., >20 hours/week)

**Platform Diversity**: Number of different platforms used (sum of endorsed platforms)

**Gaming Consistency**: Comparison of last week's hours (GQ1c) vs. typical hours (GQ1d) to assess variability in gaming behavior

#### Research Applications

The GQ data can be used to:
- Stratify samples by gaming experience level
- Control for gaming expertise in cognitive studies
- Examine platform-specific effects
- Identify gaming patterns and trends
- Screen for participants with specific gaming profiles

Gaming behavior questionnaires are commonly used in gaming research but often do not have standalone validation papers. They are typically adapted from previous studies or developed ad hoc for specific research purposes.
