#### Detailed description

The Social Network Scale (SNS) is a brief assessment tool designed to quantify the size and characteristics of an individual's social network. The measure asks concrete questions about the number of people with whom respondents have different types of social relationships and interactions.

Social network size is an important construct in social psychology and neuroscience research, as it has been linked to:
- Brain structure (e.g., amygdala volume)
- Social cognitive abilities
- Mental and physical health outcomes
- Well-being and life satisfaction

**Format**: The SNS consists of 9 items asking respondents to enumerate specific categories of social relationships and interactions.

#### Nine Social Network Questions

**1. Birthday Party Attendance (SNS1)**
- "How many were present at your 18th or 21st birthday party?"
- Retrospective estimate of milestone celebration attendance

**2. Hypothetical Party Invitations (SNS2)**
- "If you were going to have a party now, how many people would you invite?"
- Current social network breadth estimate

**3. Phone Contact List (SNS3)**
- "What is the total number of friends in your phonebook?"
- Quantifiable index of maintained contacts

**4. Celebratory Message Recipients (SNS4)**
- "Write down the names of people to whom you would send a text message marking a celebratory event (e.g., Birthday, Christmas, new job, good exam result, etc.). How many people is that?"
- Active social communication network

**5. Small Group Social Contacts (SNS5)**
- "Write down the names of people in your phonebook you would meet for a chat in a small group (one to three people). How many people is that?"
- Close conversational network

**6. Maintained School/University Friendships (SNS6)**
- "How many friends have you kept from school and university whom you could have a friendly conversation with now?"
- Enduring social connections

**7. Facebook Friends (SNS7)**
- "How many friends do you have on Facebook?"
- Online social network size (note: platform-specific, may date questionnaire)

**8. Friends Outside School/University (SNS8)**
- "How many friends do you have from outside school or university?"
- Non-institutional social connections

**9. Favor-Asking Network (SNS9)**
- "Write down the names of people of whom you feel you could ask a favor and expect to have it granted. How many people is that?"
- Support network / close relationships

#### Scoring

**Individual Item Scores**: Each item provides a count of social connections in a specific category

**Total Social Network Size**: Can be calculated by summing across items, though this may involve some double-counting of individuals

**Alternative Scoring Approaches**:
- **Average network size**: Mean across all 9 items
- **Maximum network estimate**: Largest single estimate (e.g., Facebook friends)
- **Close network size**: Average of intimate relationship items (SNS5, SNS9)
- **Broad network size**: Average of inclusive items (SNS2, SNS3, SNS7)

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate larger, more extensive social networks. Different items capture different aspects of social connectivity (e.g., close friends vs. acquaintances).

#### Research Applications

The SNS has been used to investigate:
- Relationships between social network size and brain structure
- Individual differences in social cognition
- Associations between social connectivity and mental health
- Effects of social network on well-being
- Validation of neuroimaging findings on social brain regions

#### Considerations

- **Overlap**: Many items likely count some of the same individuals
- **Temporal stability**: Some estimates (past events) are more stable than others (hypothetical scenarios)
- **Platform dependency**: Questions about specific platforms (Facebook) may become outdated
- **Cultural variation**: Social network norms vary across cultures
