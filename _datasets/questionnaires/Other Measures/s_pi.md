The Padua Inventory (PI), a self-report measure of obsessive and compulsive symptoms, is increasingly used in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) research. The Washington State University revision was constructed to measure five content dimensions relevant to OCD.

#### Detailed description

**Five Content Dimensions**:

1. **Obsessional thoughts about harm to oneself or others** (Items: 24-30; 7 items)
2. **Obsessional impulses to harm oneself or others** (Items: 31-39; 9 items)
3. **Contamination obsessions and washing compulsions** (Items: 1-10; 10 items)
4. **Checking compulsions** (Items: 14-23; 10 items)
5. **Dressing/grooming compulsions** (Items: 11-13; 3 items)

**Response Scale**: 5-point scale:
- 0 = "not at all"
- 1 = "a little"
- 2 = "quite a lot"
- 3 = "a lot"
- 4 = "very much"

The revision improves upon the original Padua Inventory by making clearer distinctions between worry, obsessions, and compulsions.
