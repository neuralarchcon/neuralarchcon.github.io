#### Detailed description

The Gaming Motivation Scale (GAMS) is a self-report measure designed to assess the different types of motivation underlying video game play. The scale is grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2000), specifically Organismic Integration Theory (OIT), which describes a continuum of motivation ranging from autonomous (self-determined) to controlled (externally regulated) forms.

Understanding gaming motivation is important for research on gaming behavior, problematic gaming, and the psychological benefits and risks associated with video game play.

Respondents rate 18 statements about why they play video games on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = "do not agree at all" to 7 = "very strongly agree").

#### Six-Factor Structure (Motivation Continuum)

**Autonomous Motivation** (more self-determined):

1. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Playing for inherent enjoyment and satisfaction
   - Gaming for the fun and pleasure of the activity itself
   - Example: "Because I think that playing video games is interesting"

2. **Integrated Regulation**: Gaming is fully integrated with one's identity and values
   - Playing because it aligns with personal values and sense of self
   - Example: "Because playing video games is part of the way I have chosen to live my life"

3. **Identified Regulation**: Playing for personally valued outcomes
   - Valuing the benefits of gaming
   - Example: "Because I believe that playing video games is good for me"

**Controlled Motivation**:

4. **Introjected Regulation**: Playing to avoid guilt or shame, or to enhance ego
   - Internal pressure to play
   - Example: "Because I would feel guilty if I did not play video games"

5. **External Regulation**: Playing for external rewards or to avoid punishment
   - Gaming due to external pressures or contingencies
   - Example: "To show others that I am good at it"

**Lack of Motivation**:

6. **Amotivation**: Lack of motivation; questioning why one plays
   - Absence of intention or purpose for gaming
   - Example: "I don't know; I can't see what I am getting out of playing video games"

#### Scoring

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate mean scores for each of the six motivation types by averaging the three items in each subscale.

**Autonomous vs. Controlled Motivation**: Can be aggregated into broader categories:
- **Autonomous Motivation**: Average of Intrinsic, Integrated, and Identified subscales
- **Controlled Motivation**: Average of Introjected and External subscales

**Self-Determination Index (SDI)**: Can be calculated by weighting subscales according to their position on the autonomy continuum:
SDI = (3 × Intrinsic) + (2 × Integrated) + (1 × Identified) - (1 × Introjected) - (2 × External) - (3 × Amotivation)

**Interpretation**: Higher autonomous motivation is associated with positive gaming experiences and well-being, while controlled motivation and amotivation are linked to problematic gaming patterns and negative outcomes.

#### Psychometric Properties

The GAMS demonstrates:
- Good internal consistency for each subscale
- Clear six-factor structure consistent with SDT
- Criterion validity with gaming behavior and psychological outcomes
- Predictive validity for depression and anxiety symptoms

#### Research Applications

The GAMS has been used to study:
- Relationships between gaming motivation and well-being
- Predictors of problematic/pathological gaming
- Individual differences in gaming experiences
- Effects of different motivational profiles on gaming outcomes
