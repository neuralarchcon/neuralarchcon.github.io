#### Detailed description

The Boredom Proneness Scale (BPS) is a self-report measure designed to assess an individual's tendency to experience boredom. Boredom proneness reflects a stable personality trait characterized by difficulty engaging with one's environment and maintaining interest in activities.

The scale was developed to measure both internal (difficulty with attention and engagement) and external (lack of environmental stimulation) factors contributing to the experience of boredom.

**Administration**: Respondents rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from "highly disagree" to "highly agree."

**Note**: The original BPS has shown inconsistent factor structure across validation studies, with different studies identifying between 2 and 7 factors. Shorter versions have been developed to address these psychometric concerns.

#### Scoring

**Total Score**: Sum of all items (some reverse-scored), with higher scores indicating greater proneness to boredom.

The BPS has been found to correlate with:
- Difficulties with attention and concentration
- Sensation seeking
- Depression and negative affect
- Lower levels of life satisfaction
