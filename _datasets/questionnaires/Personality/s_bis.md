summary: A 30-item self-report questionnaire measuring impulsivity across behavioral, cognitive, and motivational dimensions. Items are rated on a 4-point scale (1=rarely/never to 4=almost always/always). The BIS-11 is one of the most widely used measures of impulsivity in both clinical and research settings.

#### Detailed description

The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. Respondents rate each statement on a 4-point scale ranging from "rarely/never" to "almost always/always."

The BIS-11 conceptualizes impulsivity as a multidimensional construct consisting of three higher-order factors (dispositions) and six lower-order factors (sub-scales).

#### Three-Factor Structure (Dispositions)

1. **Attentional Impulsiveness**: Difficulty maintaining attention and cognitive instability (e.g., concentration difficulties, racing thoughts)
2. **Motor Impulsiveness**: Acting without thinking and lack of motor control (e.g., doing things without thinking, restlessness)
3. **Non-Planning Impulsiveness**: Lack of future orientation and careful thinking (e.g., not planning ahead, present-focused)

#### Six Sub-Scale Structure

1. **Attention**: Ability to focus on tasks and maintain cognitive stability
2. **Cognitive Complexity**: Tendency to enjoy and engage in complex cognitive tasks
3. **Cognitive Instability**: Intrusive thoughts and mind wandering
4. **Motor**: Physical restlessness and acting on the spur of the moment
5. **Perseverance**: Ability to remain with a task until completion
6. **Self-Control**: Planning and thinking carefully about decisions

**Scoring**: Total BIS-11 score is calculated by summing all 30 items, with some items reverse-scored. Higher scores indicate greater impulsivity. The three disposition scores and six sub-scale scores can also be calculated separately.

**Score Ranges**:
- Total BIS-11 score range: 30-120
- Clinical interpretations vary, but scores ≥72 are often considered indicative of high impulsivity
