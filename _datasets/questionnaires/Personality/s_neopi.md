A comprehensive personality assessment based on the Five-Factor Model (Big Five). The NEO-PI-R consists of 30 eight-item facet scales (240 questions total), with 6 facets for each of the five basic personality factors. The NEO-FFI is a shorter version with 60 items (12 items per factor). Respondents answer using a 5-point rating scale, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree."

**Note**: Different sites use different versions - Krakow uses NEO-PI-R (240 items), while other sites may use NEO-FFI (60 items minimum) or NEO-PI-3.

#### Detailed description

A personality trait refers to differences among individuals in a typical tendency to behave, think, or feel in some conceptually related ways, across a variety of relevant situations and across some fairly long period of time.

The NEO-PI-R assesses the five broad personality factors known as the Big Five:

- **Neuroticism (N)**: Characterized by a tendency to experience negative emotions like anxiety, anger, and depression, and a lower ability to cope with stress.

- **Extraversion (E)**: Measures the degree of sociability, activity level, and positive emotions, as well as assertiveness.

- **Openness (O)**: Assesses characteristics such as intellectual curiosity, imagination, sensitivity to art, and a willingness to explore new experiences.

- **Agreeableness (A)**: Encompasses tendencies toward trust, cooperation, altruism, and sympathy, opposing traits like antagonism and self-centeredness.

- **Conscientiousness (C)**: Reflects qualities such as organization, purposefulness, self-discipline, and reliability.

**Scoring**:
- Standardized Distribution: Subscales are measured through conversion of scores into t-scores
- T-scores follow a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10

**Interpretation Categories**:
- 20-35: Very Low
- 35-45: Low
- 45-55: Average
- 55-65: High
- 65-80: Very High

Within each of the five major domains, there are six more specific traits (facets) that provide a more nuanced picture of an individual's personality.
