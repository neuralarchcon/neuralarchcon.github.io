#### Detailed description

**Scoring**:
- Items 2, 5, 6, and 8 are filler questions and should not be used to calculate a final score
- Items 3, 7, and 9 should be reverse-scored using the formula: ((Number of scale points) + 1) - (Respondent's answer)
  - For example, on the 5-point scale: if a respondent answered 3, you would re-code their answer as: (5 + 1) - 3 = 2
- To calculate the total score for each participant, sum all responses except the filler questions, for a score ranging from 0 to 24

Higher scores indicate greater optimism, while lower scores indicate greater pessimism.
