#### Detailed description

The SPQ-BR is a 32-item self-report scale using a five-point ordinal response format ("strongly disagree" to "neutral" to "strongly agree") on which higher scores indicate greater schizotypy.

**Factor Structure**: The SPQ-BR has a hierarchical factor structure with three correlated higher-order factors and seven subordinate lower-order factors:

**Three Higher-Order Factors**:
1. **Cognitive Perceptual**: Ideas of Reference/Suspiciousness, Magical Thinking, and Unusual Perceptions
2. **Interpersonal**: No Close Friends/Constricted Affect and Social Anxiety
3. **Disorganized**: Eccentric Behavior and Odd Speech

**Note**: Given the differential nature of social anxiety in the context of schizotypy compared to typical variance in a healthy sample, Social Anxiety has also been tested as a separate fourth factor rather than an indicator of Interpersonal schizotypy. The SPQ-BR is reported to have two equivalently good-fitting higher-order factor structures.
