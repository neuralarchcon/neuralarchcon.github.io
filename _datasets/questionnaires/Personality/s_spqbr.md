Schizotypy represents a set of traits on which both nonclinical and schizophrenia-spectrum populations vary meaningfully. These traits are linked to biological, cognitive, and social dimensions of serious mental illness (SMI), to clinical and subclinical variation in personal and social functioning, and to risk for SMI.

#### Detailed description

The SPQ-BR is a 32-item self-report scale using a five-point ordinal response format ("strongly disagree" to "neutral" to "strongly agree") on which higher scores indicate greater schizotypy.

**Factor Structure**: The SPQ-BR has a hierarchical factor structure with three correlated higher-order factors and seven subordinate lower-order factors:

**Three Higher-Order Factors**:
1. **Cognitive Perceptual**: Ideas of Reference/Suspiciousness, Magical Thinking, and Unusual Perceptions
2. **Interpersonal**: No Close Friends/Constricted Affect and Social Anxiety
3. **Disorganized**: Eccentric Behavior and Odd Speech

**Note**: Given the differential nature of social anxiety in the context of schizotypy compared to typical variance in a healthy sample, Social Anxiety has also been tested as a separate fourth factor rather than an indicator of Interpersonal schizotypy. The SPQ-BR is reported to have two equivalently good-fitting higher-order factor structures.
