#### Detailed description

The Visual Discomfort Scale (VDS) is a self-report measure designed to assess individual differences in visual discomfort and visual stress. Visual discomfort refers to unpleasant sensations, perceptual distortions, and reduced performance when viewing certain visual stimuli, particularly high-contrast patterns, striped gratings, and text.

The VDS was developed to provide a reliable and valid measure of visual stress symptoms, which are associated with conditions such as:
- Migraine
- Reading difficulties
- Autism spectrum conditions
- Meares-Irlen syndrome (visual stress syndrome)
- Photosensitive epilepsy

**Development**: The VDS was constructed using a two-parameter Rasch Rating Scale model to ensure unidimensionality and measurement precision.

#### Content Areas

The VDS assesses various aspects of visual discomfort including:

**Pattern Sensitivity**:
- Discomfort viewing striped patterns, checks, or gratings
- Perception of illusory colors, movement, or shapes in patterns
- Aversion to high-contrast visual stimuli

**Reading-Related Difficulties**:
- Text appearing to move, blur, or shimmer
- Difficulty maintaining focus while reading
- Need for frequent breaks when reading
- Preference for specific text formats or background colors

**Environmental Sensitivity**:
- Discomfort in fluorescent or bright lighting
- Sensitivity to glare and reflections
- Difficulty in visually complex environments

**Somatic Symptoms**:
- Headaches associated with visual tasks
- Eye strain and fatigue
- Nausea or dizziness related to visual stimuli

#### Scoring

**Total Score**: Sum of all item responses, with higher scores indicating greater visual discomfort

**Interpretation**: The VDS has been validated to show that individuals with higher scores:
- Report more perceptual distortions when viewing patterns
- Experience more unpleasant side effects from visual stimuli
- Demonstrate reduced efficiency in reading and copying tasks
- Are more likely to benefit from interventions such as colored overlays or filters

#### Validation Evidence

Research has demonstrated that the VDS:
- Discriminates between individuals with and without pattern-related visual discomfort
- Correlates with objective measures of visual performance
- Predicts benefit from visual interventions (e.g., colored overlays, precision tints)
- Shows good test-retest reliability and internal consistency

#### Psychometric Properties

The VDS demonstrates:
- Good internal consistency (Cronbach's α typically > .85)
- Unidimensional structure (validated via Rasch modeling)
- Construct validity with experimentally induced visual distortions
- Sensitivity to individual differences in pattern perception
