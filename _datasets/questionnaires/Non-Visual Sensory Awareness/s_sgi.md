summary: "A 36-item self-report questionnaire measuring subjective ability to modulate, filter, and tolerate sensory stimuli. Assesses four dimensions of sensory gating: perceptual modulation, over-inclusion, distractibility, and fatigue/stress vulnerability. Commonly used in schizophrenia, ADHD, and sensory processing research."

#### Detailed description

The Sensory Gating Inventory (SGI) is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess an individual's subjective experience of sensory gating—the ability to modulate, filter, and regulate incoming sensory information. Sensory gating deficits are associated with various psychiatric and neurological conditions, including schizophrenia, ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and PTSD.

The SGI measures how individuals perceive and respond to everyday sensory experiences, including sounds, sights, tactile sensations, and other environmental stimuli.

**Theoretical Background**: Sensory gating refers to the brain's ability to filter out irrelevant or redundant sensory information to prevent sensory overload. Deficits in sensory gating can lead to difficulties with attention, concentration, and tolerance of sensory-rich environments.

#### Four-Factor Structure

1. **Perceptual Modulation (PM)**
   - Ability to adjust or regulate sensory input appropriately
   - Managing sensitivity to sensory stimuli
   - Example: Adjusting to changes in lighting or sound levels

2. **Over-Inclusion (OI)**
   - Tendency to incorporate excessive or irrelevant sensory information
   - Difficulty filtering out background or peripheral stimuli
   - Example: Being distracted by background noises or visual details

3. **Distractibility (DI)**
   - Susceptibility to attentional capture by sensory stimuli
   - Difficulty maintaining focus in the presence of competing sensory input
   - Example: Losing train of thought due to environmental distractions

4. **Fatigue and Stress Vulnerability (FS)**
   - Decreased sensory gating capacity under conditions of fatigue or stress
   - Increased sensory sensitivity when tired or stressed
   - Example: Becoming overwhelmed by sensory stimuli when fatigued

#### Administration and Scoring

**Response Format**: Items are typically rated on a Likert-type scale indicating how much each statement applies to the respondent's typical experience.

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate separate scores for each of the four factors (PM, OI, DI, FS)

**Total Score**: Sum across all items to obtain an overall sensory gating index

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater difficulties with sensory gating and sensory processing. Elevated scores are associated with increased symptomatology in various clinical populations.

#### Clinical and Research Applications

The SGI has been used to:
- Identify sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders
- Assess sensory processing difficulties in ADHD
- Investigate sensory sensitivities in autism spectrum conditions
- Study individual differences in sensory processing in the general population
- Examine relationships between subjective and objective measures of sensory gating

#### Psychometric Properties

The SGI demonstrates:
- Good internal consistency (α typically .85-.92)
- Stable 4-factor structure across multiple validations
- Test-retest reliability (ICC = .91 in Dutch validation)
- Convergent validity with clinical symptoms and personality measures
- Discriminant validity between clinical and non-clinical groups

#### SGI-Brief

A brief version (SGI-B) has been developed with excellent psychometric properties (α = .92) while maintaining external validity with measures of psychotic symptomatology and laboratory-based sensory processing tasks.
