#### Detailed description

The Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale (CAPS) is a self-report questionnaire designed to measure anomalous perceptual experiences—unusual sensory experiences that fall outside the normal range of perception. The CAPS was specifically developed to use neutral, non-clinical language to reduce stigma and encourage honest reporting.

The scale assesses perceptual anomalies across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile experiences, as well as temporal perception anomalies.

**Key Features**:
- Uses neutral language (e.g., "Do you ever sense..." rather than "Do you hallucinate...")
- Suitable for both clinical and non-clinical populations
- Assesses three dimensions for each experience: frequency, distress, and intrusiveness

#### Response Format

For each of the 32 items, respondents indicate:
1. **Frequency**: How often they experience the phenomenon (Yes/No)
2. **Distress**: How distressing the experience is (if endorsed)
3. **Intrusiveness**: How intrusive or disruptive the experience is (if endorsed)

#### Sample Items

The CAPS includes items such as:
- Sensing the presence of someone who is not physically there
- Hearing voices or sounds when no one is around
- Seeing things that others cannot see
- Experiencing unusual smells or tastes
- Feeling that time is speeding up or slowing down
- Experiencing bodily sensations without physical cause

#### Scoring

**Three Subscale Scores**:

1. **Frequency Score (CAPS Frequency)**: Total number of anomalous experiences endorsed (range: 0-32)

2. **Distress Score (CAPS Distress)**: Sum of distress ratings for endorsed items, reflecting emotional impact

3. **Intrusiveness Score (CAPS Intrusiveness)**: Sum of intrusiveness ratings for endorsed items, reflecting disruption to daily life

**Total Score (CAPS Total)**: Combined measure incorporating all three dimensions

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate more frequent and/or more distressing anomalous perceptual experiences. Approximately 11% of the general population scores above the mean of psychotic inpatient samples, though psychotic patients as a group score significantly higher.

#### Psychometric Properties

The CAPS demonstrates:
- High internal consistency (α typically .87-.90)
- Good test-retest reliability
- Strong content validity across perceptual domains
- Convergent validity with other psychosis-proneness measures
- Discriminant validity from general schizotypy measures
- Sensitivity to differences between clinical and non-clinical populations
