A self-report questionnaire used to measure an individual's subjective sensitivity to noise. The scale is composed of items addressing affective reactions and attitudes to both general noise and daily environmental sounds. Individual sensitivity is seen as lying on a continuum ranging from high to low.

#### Detailed description

Responses to each of the 21 items are scaled along a 6-point Likert scale with 0 indicating strong disagreement and 5 indicating strong agreement. After reverse coding relevant items, the unweighted sum of scores from each of the items is tallied.

**Scoring**: Stronger agreement with the items results in a higher score (ranging from 0 to 105), indicating greater individual noise sensitivity.

**Interpretation**: Highly sensitive individuals are more sensitive to, and react more negatively to, perceived noise than their less sensitive counterparts (see also Highly Sensitive Person Scale).
