#### Detailed description

The Aberrant Salience Inventory (ASI) is a self-report measure designed to assess aberrant salience, which refers to the unusual or incorrect attribution of significance, meaning, or importance to otherwise neutral or irrelevant stimuli. Aberrant salience is hypothesized to play a key role in the development of psychotic symptoms, particularly delusions.

The ASI was developed to measure subclinical psychotic experiences in general population samples and can serve as a screening tool for psychosis risk.

**Response Format**: Each of the 29 items uses a dichotomous true/false format, making the scale quick and easy to administer.

#### Five-Factor Structure

1. **Increased Significance**: Attribution of unusual meaning or importance to everyday events
   - Example: Feeling that ordinary events have special personal significance

2. **Sharpening of Senses**: Enhanced or heightened sensory perception
   - Example: Noticing details that others seem to miss

3. **Impending Understanding**: Sense that one is on the verge of an important insight or revelation
   - Example: Feeling close to discovering something important about the world

4. **Heightened Emotionality**: Increased emotional intensity and reactivity
   - Example: Experiencing emotions more intensely than usual

5. **Heightened Cognition**: Racing thoughts and increased mental activity
   - Example: Thoughts moving unusually fast

#### Scoring

**Total Score**: Sum of "true" responses across all 29 items, ranging from 0 to 29.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater levels of aberrant salience and psychosis proneness.

**Screening Utility**: Research has shown that:
- Individuals with a history of psychosis score significantly higher than psychiatric and non-clinical comparison groups
- The ASI demonstrates adequate positive and negative predictive values for use as a screening tool
- Elevated ASI scores are associated with both clinical and subclinical psychotic experiences

#### Psychometric Properties

The ASI demonstrates:
- Good internal consistency (α typically > .80)
- Single second-order factor with five first-order factors
- Convergent validity with other measures of psychosis proneness
- Discriminant validity from general psychopathology
- Sensitivity to group differences between psychotic and non-psychotic samples
