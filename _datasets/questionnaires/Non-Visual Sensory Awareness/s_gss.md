#### Detailed description

The GSS is appropriate for measuring sensory processing differences in individuals with and without ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder).

The questionnaire contains 42 items on 14 subscales concerning seven sensory modalities:
- Visual (6 items)
- Auditory (6 items)
- Gustatory (6 items)
- Olfactory (6 items)
- Tactile (6 items)
- Vestibular (6 items)
- Proprioception (6 items)

For each modality, three items relate to hypersensitivity and three items relate to hyposensitivity.

**Response Scale**: Individuals indicate the extent to which they experience the content of each statement on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Never to 4 = Always).

**Scoring**: Total scores range between 0 to 168 points.

**Note**: The scale is not freely available; approval from authors must be obtained for use.
