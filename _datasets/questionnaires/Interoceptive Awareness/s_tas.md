summary: A 20-item self-report questionnaire measuring alexithymia, the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The TAS-20 assesses three key dimensions of alexithymia and is the most widely used measure of this construct.

#### Detailed description

The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) is a self-report instrument designed to measure alexithymia, a personality construct characterized by difficulties identifying and describing emotions, distinguishing emotions from bodily sensations, and externally oriented thinking.

Alexithymia has been associated with various psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, and somatic symptom disorders.

Respondents rate their agreement with each statement on a 5-point Likert scale: 1=strongly disagree, 2=moderately disagree, 3=neither agree nor disagree, 4=moderately agree, 5=strongly agree.

#### Three-Factor Structure

1. **Difficulty Identifying Feelings (DIF)**: 7 items
   - Difficulty distinguishing between feelings and bodily sensations of emotional arousal
   - Example: "I am often confused about what emotion I am feeling"

2. **Difficulty Describing Feelings (DDF)**: 5 items
   - Difficulty describing feelings to other people
   - Example: "It is difficult for me to find the right words for my feelings"

3. **Externally Oriented Thinking (EOT)**: 8 items
   - Tendency to focus on external events rather than inner experiences
   - Example: "I prefer to analyze problems rather than just describe them" (reverse-scored)

#### Scoring

**Item-Level Scoring**: Items are scored 1-5 based on the Likert responses. Five items (4, 5, 10, 18, 19) are negatively keyed and must be reverse-scored.

**Total Score**: Sum of all 20 items, ranging from 20 to 100.

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate by summing items within each factor.

**Interpretation**:
- ≤51: Non-alexithymia
- 52-60: Possible alexithymia
- ≥61: Alexithymia

Higher scores indicate greater alexithymic traits.

#### Psychometric Properties

The TAS-20 has demonstrated:
- Good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .81)
- Test-retest reliability (r = .77, p < .01)
- Three-factor structure replicated across clinical and non-clinical populations
- Convergent and concurrent validity
- Cross-cultural validity (translated into 30+ languages)

**Note**: The EOT subscale sometimes shows lower internal consistency than the other two factors.
