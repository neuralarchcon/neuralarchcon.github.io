A 37-item self-report questionnaire that measures multiple dimensions of interoceptive awareness. Interoceptive awareness is defined as the conscious level of interoception with its multiple dimensions potentially accessible to self-report. The questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale and assesses eight dimensions of interoception.

#### Detailed description

The MAIA-2 consists of 37 items organized into 8 scales (factors) that measure different dimensions of interoception:

1. **Noticing**: Awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral body sensations (4 items)
2. **Not-Distracting**: Tendency not to ignore or distract oneself from sensations of pain or discomfort (6 items, reverse-scored)
3. **Not-Worrying**: Tendency not to worry or experience emotional distress with sensations of pain or discomfort (5 items, some reverse-scored)
4. **Attention Regulation**: Ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations (7 items)
5. **Emotional Awareness**: Awareness of the connection between body sensations and emotional states (5 items)
6. **Self-Regulation**: Ability to regulate distress by attention to body sensations (4 items)
7. **Body Listening**: Active listening to the body for insight (3 items)
8. **Trusting**: Experience of one's body as safe and trustworthy (3 items)

**Scoring**: Take the average of the items on each scale. Note that items 5-10 (Not-Distracting scale) and items 11, 12, and 15 (Not-Worrying scale) are reverse-scored using the formula (5 - x).
