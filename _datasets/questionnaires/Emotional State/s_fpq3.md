A 30-item questionnaire designed to assess fear of pain across different types of pain experiences. Participants rate the extent of fear in response to various pain scenarios on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not afraid at all, 5 = extremely afraid).

#### Detailed description

The FPQ-III is divided into three factorially distinct subscales, each consisting of 10 questions:

1. **Severe Pain**: Fear related to major painful events (e.g., being involved in a car accident)
2. **Minor Pain**: Fear related to everyday minor painful events (e.g., biting your tongue)
3. **Medical Pain**: Fear related to medical procedures (e.g., receiving an injection in your mouth)

**Scoring**: The total score ranges from 30 to 150, with higher scores indicating greater fear of pain.

**Validity**: Research has shown that high fear of pain individuals had greater avoidance/escape from a pain-relevant Behavioral Avoidance Test with Video, relative to their low fear counterparts, suggesting good predictive validity.
