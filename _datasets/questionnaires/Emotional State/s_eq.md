The EQ-Short scale measures individual differences in a tendency to empathize. Empathizing means "following" another person's emotions. Empathizing involves identifying another person's emotional state and thoughts, in order to understand and respond to them appropriately, manifesting pro-social behavior directed towards meeting the needs of a fellow human being.

#### Detailed description

The EQ-Short includes 22 items that refer to an ability to recognize thoughts or feelings of another person and to react to these thoughts and feelings with adequate behavior.

The scale allows for assessment of empathy as a cognitive and affective ability to understand and respond to others' mental and emotional states.
