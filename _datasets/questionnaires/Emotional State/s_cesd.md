#### Detailed description

The CES-D is designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. Items assess symptoms such as depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance.

**Scoring**:
- For items 1-3, 5-7, 9-11, 13-15, 17-20:
  - Rarely or none of the time (less than one day) = 0
  - Some or a little of the time (1-2 days) = 1
  - Occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3-4 days) = 2
  - Most or all of the time (5-7 days) = 3

- Items 4, 8, 12, 16 are reverse scored:
  - Most or all of the time (5-7 days) = 0
  - Occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3-4 days) = 1
  - Some or a little of the time (1-2 days) = 2
  - Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day) = 3

**Interpretation**: Possible range of scores is 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology. The CES-D provides cutoff scores (e.g., 16 or greater) that aid in identifying individuals at risk for clinical depression, with good sensitivity and specificity and high internal consistency.

**Factor Structure**: The scale has demonstrated good goodness of fit with model parameters: S-B χ2 = 1075.03; df = 166; p < 0.01; GFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.98; CFI = 0.98; RMSEA = 0.069; RMSEA 95% CI [0.065; 0.073].
