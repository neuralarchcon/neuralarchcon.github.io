The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely used measure designed to assess perceptions of recent stress. Informed by Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress, this self-report questionnaire is used to assess the degree to which a respondent finds circumstances in their life to be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and/or overwhelming. In contrast to measures that assess environmental stress exposures, the PSS focuses on subjective appraisal of stress.

#### Detailed description

Over repeat administrations, variability in scores on the Perceived Stress Scale results more from differences between participants than from within-person changes over time, making it particularly useful for cross-sectional individual difference studies.

**Scoring**:
- First, reverse scores for questions 4, 5, 7, and 8:
  - 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1, 4 = 0
- Add up scores for each item to get a total

**Interpretation**:
- Individual scores can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress
- Scores 0-13: Low stress
- Scores 14-26: Moderate stress
- Scores 27-40: High perceived stress
