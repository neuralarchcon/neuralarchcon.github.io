#### Detailed description

The IRI has 4 subscales (factors), each made up of 7 different items:

1. **Perspective Taking (PT)**: The tendency to spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others
2. **Fantasy (FS)**: Taps respondents' tendencies to transpose themselves imaginatively into the feelings and actions of fictitious characters in books, movies, and plays
3. **Empathic Concern (EC)**: Assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern for unfortunate others
4. **Personal Distress (PD)**: Measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease in tense interpersonal settings

**Scoring**:
- Standard items: A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4
- Reversed items: A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, E=0

**Research Findings**: Davis (1983) reported perspective taking to be associated with measures of interpersonal functioning and self-esteem, fantasy scores to be generally related to chronic emotionality and intelligence, and empathic concern to be associated with emotionality and concern for others. Personal distress was observed to be related to lower self-esteem and lower interpersonal functioning.
