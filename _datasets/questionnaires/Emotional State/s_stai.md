#### Detailed description

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological assessment tool designed to measure anxiety in adults. Developed by Charles Spielberger and colleagues, the STAI is based on the distinction between state anxiety (a temporary emotional state) and trait anxiety (a stable personality characteristic).

The STAI has become the most widely used instrument for measuring anxiety in research settings and has been translated into over 60 languages.

#### Two Components

**1. State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety)**
- Measures current, temporary anxiety state
- Assesses how respondents feel "right now, at this moment"
- Reflects transient feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry
- Sensitive to situational stress and can fluctuate over time
- Example items: "I feel calm" (reverse-scored), "I feel nervous"

**2. Trait Anxiety Scale (T-Anxiety)**
- Measures relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness
- Assesses how respondents "generally feel"
- Reflects tendency to perceive situations as threatening and respond with anxiety
- More stable across time and situations
- Example items: "I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter," "I am content" (reverse-scored)

#### Administration and Format

Each scale contains 20 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale:

**State Scale**:
- 1 = Not at all
- 2 = Somewhat
- 3 = Moderately so
- 4 = Very much so

**Trait Scale**:
- 1 = Almost never
- 2 = Sometimes
- 3 = Often
- 4 = Almost always

#### Scoring

Each scale is scored separately by summing the item responses, with some items reverse-scored.

**Score Range**: 20-80 for each scale

**Interpretation**:
- 20-37: Low anxiety
- 38-44: Moderate anxiety
- 45-80: High anxiety

Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The scales can be administered together or separately depending on research or clinical needs.

#### Psychometric Properties

The STAI demonstrates:
- High internal consistency (α typically .86-.95)
- Good test-retest reliability for trait anxiety
- Variable test-retest for state anxiety (as expected for a state measure)
- Extensive normative data across diverse populations
- Strong concurrent and construct validity

#### Shortened Versions

Several brief versions have been developed:
- STAI-6: 6-item short form (Marteau & Bekker, 1992)
- STAI-Y6: Alternative 6-item version
