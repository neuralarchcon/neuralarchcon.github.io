#### Detailed description

The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a comprehensive self-report measure designed to assess multiple aspects of emotion regulation and dysregulation. The measure was developed based on a clinically useful conceptualization of emotion regulation that encompasses six dimensions of emotion dysregulation.

Respondents rate the extent to which each item applies to them on a 5-point scale ranging from "almost never" (1) to "almost always" (5).

#### Six Subscales

1. **Nonacceptance of Emotional Responses (NONACCEPT)**: Non-acceptance of distress; negative secondary emotional responses to one's negative emotions
   - Example: "When I'm upset, I feel guilty for feeling that way"

2. **Difficulty Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior (GOALS)**: Difficulties concentrating and accomplishing tasks when experiencing negative emotions
   - Example: "When I'm upset, I have difficulty concentrating"

3. **Impulse Control Difficulties (IMPULSE)**: Difficulty remaining in control of one's behavior when experiencing negative emotions
   - Example: "When I'm upset, I have difficulty controlling my behaviors"

4. **Lack of Emotional Awareness (AWARE)**: Inattention to and lack of awareness of emotional responses
   - Example: "I pay attention to how I feel" (reverse-scored)

5. **Limited Access to Emotion Regulation Strategies (STRATEGIES)**: Belief that there is little that can be done to regulate emotions effectively once upset
   - Example: "When I'm upset, I believe that there is nothing I can do to make myself feel better"

6. **Lack of Emotional Clarity (CLARITY)**: Extent to which individuals know and are clear about the emotions they are experiencing
   - Example: "I have difficulty making sense out of my feelings"

#### Scoring

**Total Score**: Sum of all 36 items (with reverse-scored items), ranging from 36 to 180. Higher scores indicate greater difficulties in emotion regulation.

**Subscale Scores**: Calculated by summing items within each dimension. The DERS has demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .93), good test-retest reliability, and adequate construct and predictive validity.

**Interpretation**: Higher scores reflect greater problems with emotion regulation. The DERS has been extensively validated across clinical and non-clinical populations.

#### Shortened Versions

Several brief versions have been developed:
- DERS-16 (Bjureberg et al., 2016)
- DERS-18 (Victor & Klonsky, 2016)
- DERS-SF (Kaufman et al., 2016)
