summary: A 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess hedonic tone and anhedonia, the reduced capacity to experience pleasure. Each item describes a pleasurable experience, and respondents indicate their agreement on a 4-point scale. The SHAPS is widely used in depression research and clinical practice.

#### Detailed description

The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a self-report instrument designed to measure anhedonia, the diminished ability to experience pleasure. Anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder and is also present in other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

The SHAPS was developed to provide a rapid screening tool for assessing hedonic capacity across four domains of pleasure response:
- Social interaction
- Food and drink
- Sensory experience
- Interest/pastimes

#### Administration and Format

The scale consists of 14 items, each describing a potentially pleasurable experience. For each item, respondents choose from four response categories:
1. Definitely agree
2. Agree
3. Disagree
4. Definitely disagree

Respondents are instructed to indicate how much they would enjoy each activity if they were to experience it.

#### Sample Items

Items cover diverse sources of pleasure:
- "I would enjoy my favorite meal"
- "I would enjoy being with my family or close friends"
- "I would enjoy seeing other people's smiling faces"
- "I would enjoy a warm bath or refreshing shower"

#### Scoring

**Scoring Method**: Each item can be scored dichotomously (0 or 1) or using the full 4-point scale. In dichotomous scoring:
- "Definitely agree" or "Agree" = 0 (normal hedonic response)
- "Disagree" or "Definitely disagree" = 1 (anhedonic response)

**Total Score Range**: 0-14 (using dichotomous scoring)

**Interpretation**:
- Higher scores indicate greater anhedonia
- Scores ≥3 are often used as a cutoff for clinically significant anhedonia
- The SHAPS has demonstrated unidimensional structure and good internal consistency

#### Psychometric Properties

The SHAPS has shown:
- Good internal consistency (Cronbach's α typically .80-.92)
- Test-retest reliability
- Convergent validity with other measures of depression and anhedonia
- Sensitivity to change with treatment
