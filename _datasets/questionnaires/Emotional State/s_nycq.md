summary: A 31-item self-report questionnaire assessing the content and form of self-generated thoughts during resting-state fMRI. Measures multiple dimensions of thought including social cognition, temporal focus (future/past), emotional valence, and modality (words/images). Designed to characterize individual differences in resting-state mentation.

#### Detailed description

The New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q) is a self-report instrument designed to assess the phenomenology of self-generated thoughts experienced during resting-state fMRI scanning. Unlike task-based paradigms, resting-state scans allow the mind to wander freely, and the NYC-Q captures the nature of these spontaneous mental experiences.

The questionnaire asks participants to reflect on the thoughts and feelings they experienced while lying in the MRI scanner during the resting-state acquisition, providing a window into the content and form of unconstrained cognition.

**Administration**: Typically administered immediately after a resting-state fMRI scan to minimize memory decay and maximize accuracy of retrospective reporting.

#### Dimensions Assessed

The NYC-Q was developed using exploratory factor analysis and captures multiple dimensions of self-generated thought:

**Content Dimensions** (what people think about):

1. **Social Cognition**: Thoughts about other people, social interactions, and relationships
   - Thinking about others' mental states
   - Social scenarios and interactions

2. **Future**: Forward-looking thoughts, planning, and anticipation
   - Goals and intentions
   - Upcoming events

3. **Past**: Retrospective thoughts and memories
   - Autobiographical memory
   - Previous experiences

4. **Positive Emotional Content**: Pleasant, positive thoughts
   - Enjoyable experiences
   - Optimistic thinking

5. **Negative Emotional Content**: Unpleasant, negative thoughts
   - Worries and concerns
   - Negative rumination

**Form Dimensions** (how thoughts are represented):

6. **Words**: Verbal, linguistic thought
   - Internal speech
   - Verbal reasoning

7. **Images**: Visual mental imagery
   - Mental pictures
   - Visual simulation

8. **Specificity**: Level of detail and concreteness
   - Vividness of thought
   - Specific vs. abstract content

#### Scoring

**Factor Scores**: Calculate scores for each dimension by averaging relevant items identified through factor analysis

**Interpretation**: Individual profiles reveal:
- Predominant content themes during rest
- Preferred modality of thought (verbal vs. visual)
- Temporal orientation (past vs. future)
- Emotional tone of spontaneous thought

#### Research Applications

The NYC-Q has been used to:
- Link thought patterns to brain functional connectivity
- Investigate individual differences in resting-state cognition
- Study relationships between mind wandering and brain networks
- Examine how thought content relates to default mode network activity

#### Relationship to Brain Networks

Research using the NYC-Q has demonstrated correspondences between:
- **Default mode network**: Associated with internally-directed thought
- **Frontoparietal control network**: Related to deliberate, controlled thinking
- **Visual network**: Linked to imagery-based thought
- Individual connectivity patterns predict specific thought patterns

#### Psychometric Properties

The NYC-Q demonstrates:
- Clear multi-dimensional factor structure
- Internal consistency within factors
- Sensitivity to individual differences
- Correlations with brain functional architecture
- Face validity for assessing resting-state experience
