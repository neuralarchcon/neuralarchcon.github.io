A comprehensive assessment of adult intelligence based on Wechsler's construct of intelligence: "The general capacity of an individual to undertake purposeful actions, think rationally, and cope effectively with the environment."

**Important Note**: Different sites use different versions:
- Aarhus: WAIS-4
- Brno: WAIS-3
- Krakow: WAIS-R

#### Detailed description

Wechsler's construct posits that intelligence consists of abilities that are qualitatively different but not entirely independent. Intelligence is conceived as a type of energy that manifests itself in various types of intellectual abilities.

Intelligence is not a simple sum of parts because:
1. Effective behavior is related to the configuration of abilities (two people with the same IQ may differ in performing a given type of task)
2. "Intellectual" behavior is influenced by non-intellectual factors (personality, stress management, etc.)
3. A surplus in one ability does not necessarily translate into a generally higher level of functioning (e.g., an arithmetic genius may function poorly in other abilities)

The WAIS consists of two main categories of subtests:

**Verbal Subtests**:
- **Information**: Assesses general knowledge and cultural background
- **Comprehension**: Measures reasoning and judgment
- **Arithmetic**: Evaluates numerical reasoning
- **Digit Span**: Tests short-term memory and attention
- **Similarities**: Assesses abstract thinking by asking how two things are alike
- **Vocabulary**: Measures word knowledge and verbal ability

**Performance Subtests**:
- **Picture Arrangement**: Involves arranging pictures in a meaningful sequence
- **Picture Completion**: Requires the identification of missing parts in a picture
- **Block Design**: Assesses visual-spatial abilities by having the subject assemble blocks to form a design
- **Object Assembly**: Tests the ability to assemble objects from a set of shapes
- **Digit Symbol**: Measures psychomotor speed and coding ability by associating symbols with numbers
