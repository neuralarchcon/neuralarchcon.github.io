{% include JB/setup %}

Brief self-report questionnaires designed to distinguish between spontaneous and deliberate forms of mind-wandering. The measures consist of 8 items total, assessing the frequency and characteristics of different types of mind-wandering experiences.

#### Detailed description

**MW-S (Mind-Wandering Spontaneous)**: Assesses unintentional shifts of attention away from the current task or environment to internal thoughts and mental content.

**MW-D (Mind-Wandering Deliberate)**: Assesses intentional shifts of attention away from the current task or environment to engage in internal thoughts and mental content.

These scales help differentiate between mind-wandering that occurs automatically versus mind-wandering that is intentionally initiated by the individual.
