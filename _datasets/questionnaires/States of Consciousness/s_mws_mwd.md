#### Detailed description

The Spontaneous and Deliberate Mind Wandering Scales (SDMWS) consist of two brief self-report measures designed to assess individual differences in the tendency to experience different types of mind wandering. The scales distinguish between:

- **Spontaneous mind wandering (MW-S)**: Unintentional, off-task thoughts that occur without conscious effort
- **Deliberate mind wandering (MW-D)**: Intentional, self-directed shifts of attention away from the task at hand

This distinction is theoretically important because spontaneous and deliberate mind wandering have different cognitive correlates, consequences, and associations with executive function.

Respondents rate their agreement with statements about their typical mind wandering experiences on a 7-point Likert scale.

#### Two Subscales

**1. Mind Wandering: Spontaneous (MW-S)** - 4 items
Assesses unintentional, involuntary mind wandering experiences:
- Thoughts that come to mind unbidden
- Difficulty keeping mind from wandering
- Mind drifting without intention
- Example: "I find my thoughts wandering spontaneously"

**2. Mind Wandering: Deliberate (MW-D)** - 4 items
Assesses intentional, voluntary mind wandering experiences:
- Deliberately allowing mind to wander
- Intentionally thinking about things unrelated to current task
- Conscious decision to let mind drift
- Example: "I allow my thoughts to wander on purpose"

#### Scoring

**Subscale Scores**: Calculate mean or sum of the 4 items for each subscale separately

**Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate greater tendency for that type of mind wandering

**Important**: The two scales should be scored and interpreted independently, as they represent distinct constructs with different correlates:
- **Spontaneous MW** correlates with executive function failures, ADHD symptoms, and poorer performance on attention-demanding tasks
- **Deliberate MW** shows weaker or sometimes opposite relationships with these variables

#### Theoretical Background

The distinction between spontaneous and deliberate mind wandering is grounded in research showing that:
- Not all mind wandering is the same
- Intentionality matters for understanding consequences
- Executive control plays different roles in each type
- The two types have different relationships with task performance and well-being

#### Psychometric Properties

The SDMWS demonstrates:
- Good internal consistency for both subscales (α typically > .80)
- Discriminant validity (low correlation between the two scales)
- Convergent validity with related measures (attention, executive function)
- Predictive validity for task performance and real-world outcomes
- Stability across multiple validation studies

#### Research Applications

The SDMWS has been used to study:
- Individual differences in attention and executive function
- Mind wandering in ADHD and other clinical conditions
- Relationships between mind wandering and well-being
- Cognitive correlates of different mind wandering types
- Mind wandering during resting-state and task performance
