#### Detailed description

The Multi-Dimensional Experience Sampling (MDES) questionnaire is designed to assess the multifaceted nature of subjective experience during resting states, meditation, or other periods of unconstrained mental activity. The measure captures various dimensions of conscious experience beyond just thought content, including meta-cognitive awareness, bodily sensations, and emotional states.

Experience sampling methods provide rich phenomenological data that complement objective measures (e.g., neuroimaging, physiology) by directly assessing first-person experience.

**Administration**: Typically administered immediately following a period of rest or meditation to capture participants' subjective experiences while memory is still fresh.

#### Dimensions Typically Assessed

Multi-dimensional experience sampling questionnaires often include:

**1. Thought Content and Quality**
- Presence and frequency of thoughts
- Mind wandering vs. focused attention
- Verbal vs. visual thought
- Self-referential vs. other-focused content

**2. Temporal Orientation**
- Past-oriented thinking (memory, rumination)
- Future-oriented thinking (planning, anticipation)
- Present-moment awareness

**3. Emotional State**
- Valence (positive/negative)
- Arousal (high/low)
- Specific emotions (calm, anxiety, joy, etc.)

**4. Bodily Awareness**
- Interoceptive sensations
- Body awareness and attention to physical sensations
- Comfort/discomfort

**5. Meta-Awareness**
- Awareness of one's own mental state
- Ability to observe thoughts without engagement
- Metacognitive monitoring

**6. Attentional Quality**
- Focus vs. distraction
- Effort required to maintain attention
- Ease of concentration

**7. Phenomenological Characteristics**
- Sense of presence
- Absorption in experience
- Clarity of awareness

#### Scoring

**Dimension Scores**: Calculate mean or sum for items within each experiential dimension

**Profile Analysis**: Individual patterns across dimensions reveal:
- Predominant experiential states
- Balance between different modes of experience
- Relationships between dimensions (e.g., thought and emotion)

**Interpretation**: Scores reflect the quality and content of subjective experience during the sampled period. Can be used to:
- Characterize individual differences in resting-state experience
- Track changes across conditions (e.g., before/after intervention)
- Relate subjective states to neural or physiological measures

#### Applications

Experience sampling measures are used in:
- Meditation research (comparing different practices)
- Resting-state fMRI studies (linking experience to brain activity)
- Clinical interventions (mindfulness, therapy)
- Consciousness research (studying phenomenology)
- Individual differences research (baseline mental states)

#### Related Measures

The MDES is conceptually related to other experience sampling tools:
- **ARSQ-2** (Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire)
- **NYC-Q** (New York Cognition Questionnaire)
- **ReSQ** (Resting State Questionnaire)
- **MAAS** (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale)
