summary: A 54-item retrospective self-report questionnaire used to capture mind-wandering experiences during the resting state. The ARSQ-2 was developed within the context of a study of age and personality effects on mind-wandering experiences. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1–5). NOTE - In this multi-site study implementation, the response option "Neither agree nor disagree" was accidentally omitted from the questionnaire at all sites.

#### Detailed description

The ARSQ-2 consists of 10 dimensions that capture different aspects of subjective experience during resting state:

1. **Discontinuity of Mind**: Fragmentation and disruption of thought flow
2. **Theory of Mind**: Thinking about others' mental states
3. **Self**: Self-related thinking and introspection
4. **Planning**: Future-oriented and goal-directed thinking
5. **Sleepiness**: Drowsiness and fatigue
6. **Comfort**: Physical and mental comfort
7. **Somatic Awareness**: Awareness of bodily sensations
8. **Health Concern**: Thoughts about health and well-being
9. **Visual Thought**: Visual imagery in thoughts
10. **Verbal Thought**: Linguistic/verbal form of thoughts

The item order for the extended ARSQ is randomized, except for the last two validation items ("I had my eyes closed" and "I was able to rate the statements"). These validation items help identify invalid trials where participants may have been interrupted during the rest session.

**Administration**: Typically administered after MRI resting-state scan.
