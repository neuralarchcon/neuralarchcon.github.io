A questionnaire for measuring mindfulness that is most suitable in generalized contexts, where knowledge of the Buddhist background of mindfulness cannot be expected. The 14 items cover all aspects of mindfulness including present-moment awareness, non-judgmental acceptance, and openness to experience.

#### Detailed description

The FMI uses a 4-point Likert scale and provides a comprehensive assessment of mindfulness as a trait and state construct.

**Scoring**:
- Add up all items to get one summary score
- One item requires reverse coding: "I am impatient with myself and with others"
- For reversed items, recode: 1→4, 2→3, 3→2, 4→1

**Factor Structure**: At present, using separate factor-scale scores is not recommended. If separate factors are desired, it is recommended to analyze the specific dataset and extract 4 to 6 factors according to the data structure found, then proceed by adding up item scores per scale.
