#### Detailed description

The FMI uses a 4-point Likert scale and provides a comprehensive assessment of mindfulness as a trait and state construct.

**Scoring**:
- Add up all items to get one summary score
- One item requires reverse coding: "I am impatient with myself and with others"
- For reversed items, recode: 1→4, 2→3, 3→2, 4→1

**Factor Structure**: At present, using separate factor-scale scores is not recommended. If separate factors are desired, it is recommended to analyze the specific dataset and extract 4 to 6 factors according to the data structure found, then proceed by adding up item scores per scale.
