#### Detailed description

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a simple, self-administered questionnaire that measures the general level of daytime sleepiness, or average sleep propensity, in daily life. It has become one of the most commonly used tools for assessing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).

The scale asks respondents to rate their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities that differ in their somnificity (sleep-inducing quality). Activities range from passive situations (sitting and reading, watching TV) to more active ones (in a car while stopped for a few minutes in traffic).

**Scoring**: Each item is rated from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing). Scores are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 24.

**Score Interpretation**:
- 0-10: Normal daytime sleepiness
- 11-14: Mild excessive daytime sleepiness
- 15-17: Moderate excessive daytime sleepiness
- 18-24: Severe excessive daytime sleepiness

Scores of 11 or higher are often used as a cutoff for clinically significant excessive daytime sleepiness and may warrant further evaluation for sleep disorders.

#### Eight Situations Assessed

1. Sitting and reading
2. Watching television
3. Sitting inactive in a public place (e.g., theater or meeting)
4. As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break
5. Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit
6. Sitting and talking to someone
7. Sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol
8. In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic
