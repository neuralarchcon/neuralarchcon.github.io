summary: Metacognitive judgments of learning (JOLs) in a 30-trial memory task with emotional words. Participants study emotional and neutral adjectives, provide prospective confidence ratings about recall difficulty, complete a distracting task, then recall as many words as possible.

#### Detailed description:

* Each trial began with a 500-millisecond fixation point, which was followed by a 5-second presentation of a word and a JOL scale. Participants studied theword for 5 seconds and had to give JOLs before proceeding to the next item. The JOL scale was presented alongside with a question about how easy it would be to recall the presented word later. The scale was continuous but had 5 main sections: “Very Hard”, “Hard”,“Moderate”, “Easy”, and “Very Easy”. Participants were informed that they could choose different points within each scale category (with a mouse click). The study phase wasfollowed by the distracting task, which lasted 3 minutes. 
* Each trial of the distracting task began with a 1000 ms waiting period followed by a 500 ms presentation of fixation point. Then the words “right” or “left” were present ed in the centre of the computer screen and participants were instructed to press the arrow key indicated by the word. Immediately afterthe distracting task, participants were asked to write down as many words from the memory task as possible within 3 minutes. 
* At the end of the session, participants were questioned about what they thought was the goal of the study. No participants correctly guessed theexact hypotheses, although many noted that the items had different emotional values. At the end, participants were fully debriefed. The experimental session took approximately 20minutes.
* The list of words used in the memory task consisted of 10 neutral, 10 negative and 10 positive adjectives. The words were associated with mood and self-esteem (e.g., sad, useless, relaxed, happy). Because the Polish language has grammatical gender, we used masculine or feminine versions of the adjectives depending on the participant’s gender. Words of different emotional valence were matched for frequency, length and imageability.
