summary: Binocular rivalry task with flickering green/red gratings presented at two different frequencies (4.5 or 20 Hz). Participants report dominant visual percept while receiving occasional crossmodal cues (auditory, tactile, or simultaneous) matching one of the flickering frequencies.

#### Detailed description

*  Each eye was presented with a 4.5 or 20 Hz sinusoidal flicker throughout 3 min blocks. Subjects reported their perceptual state through button-press. Crossmodal cues (also 4.5 or 20 Hz; 2, 3.1 or 4 s in duration) or visual-only periods (2.6 s in duration) were separated by inter-stimulus intervals of 7–10 s.
* * A total of 24 three-minute binocular rivalry blocks were presented on each of the two separate days of testing. In each block, subjects reported their dominant visual percept during rivalry while receiving occasional crossmodal cues, which were either auditory, tactile, or simultaneous auditory and tactile. In a given three-minute block, we presented only one of the three types of crossmodal cues. The order of these blocks were randomized for each subject and each day of experimentation. In each block, 12 trials of crossmodal cues were presented. Each cue was either low (4.5 Hz) or high (20 Hz) frequency auditory and/or tactile stimulation. Six cues were presented for each frequency, with durations composed of three x 2 s, two x 3.1 s, and one x 4 s cues. To increase uncertainty for the timing of the cues, we inserted three null cues (which we call visual-only periods) without any crossmodal stimulation for a duration of 2.6 s (the average duration of crossmodal cues). We also used these visual-only periods as a baseline for behavioral analyses. We randomized the order of all cues, which were separated with uniform jittering by 7–10 s ISI within each block.
* Across all sessions, subjects were told to focus on accurately reporting their dominant visual percept at all times via button-press. As the state of the button-press was sampled at 60 Hz, the same rate as the video refresh rate, we were able to estimate the probability and time-course of binocular rivalry dynamics over 16.7 ms intervals.
* Over two sessions on separate days, subjects distributed attention between visual rivalry and crossmodal cues based on separate task instructions. On day 1 for _n_ = 18 or day 2 for _n_ = 16, subjects were instructed to ignore the crossmodal cues and to focus on reporting only visual rivalry. For the other session, subjects were instructed to distribute attention across both visual rivalry and crossmodal cues. To ensure their attention was on task, these alternate days included task instructions for subjects to silently tally the number of times the temporal frequency of an attended crossmodal cue matched that of their dominant visual percept at the time of crossmodal cue’s offset. Due to the varied duration of crossmodal cues, this task ensured that attention was allocated consistently throughout the presentation of crossmodal cues.
