 Scene-item ( landscape fotographs and objects) paired associative memory task with confidence rating after recognition of old or new pairs. Additionally, there is a repeated encoding of the pairs, followed by recognition of single scenes and a cued recall.

#### Detailed description:

-   In the first block participants are shown 48 picture pairs, consisting of a scene (desert, river, road or golf court) and an item (common object, animal or plant). The pairs are presented sequentially, each displayed for 2.5 seconds. Participants are instructed to try to memorize the scene-item pairs. They are then presented with 96 scene-item pairs (48 old pairs + 48 new pairs but consisting of known pictures) and have to indicate, via pressing certain keys, if they recognize the pair as old pair or if they believe it to be new. Following each response, participants have to rate their confidence on the previous decision on a scale from 1 to 6 (1: 50% = guessing, 2: 60%, 3: 70%, 4: 80%, 5: 90%, 6: 100%).

-   In the second block (happening immediately after the first one) participants are shown the old 48 scene-item pairs again and are instructed to try to memorize them. Then they are presented with 96 single scenes (48 old scenes + 48 new scenes) and have to indicate, via key press, if they recognize the particular scene or if they think it is a new scene. If a scene is recognized as old, an optional text field appears, allowing participants to recall and type the associated item.
