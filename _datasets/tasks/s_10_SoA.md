#### Detailed description

* The experiment was displayed on a 24-in. Dell P2417H monitor, at a resolution of 1,920 × 1,080 (refresh rate = 60 Hz). On-ear headphones (Philips shb8850nc) with active noise canceling were used to mask sounds from the environment and to present auditory stimuli. Participants wore the headphones for the entire session (apart from the training). Motion tracking and virtual modeling of each participant's right hand was realized by a Leap Motion controller (Leap Motion Inc., San Francisco, CA), creating a virtual-reality model of the hand in real time. Responses were given with a numeric keyboard, with all the keys blocked except three: left, right, and Enter. The left key had a left red arrow on it, the right key had a right green arrow on it, and the Enter key had a black circle on it and a slightly different texture (to allow easy identification). Intrinsic delay of the system was 80 ms. 
* Each trial started by presenting (i) a fixation cross, then (ii) the modeled virtual hand (in which the participants conducted a movement and saw it on-screen, either altered or unaltered), followed by (iii) an agency question regarding the movement they conducted and saw. Afterward, (iv) a sound consisting of pink noise and non-word syllables was played. The participants were then asked (v) whether they did or did not hear a word. Experiment 2: Similar to Experiment 1, excluding the played sound (iv) and the sound question (v). (B) Experimental setup. Participants sat in front of the monitor, laying their right hand on the right plate (covered by a black cloth) directly beneath the Leap Motion controller and saw their modeled, virtual hand on the right side of the monitor (picture from Experiment 2).
* The left half of the screen was covered with a black cloth in order to focus participants' attention to the right of the screen (where the stimuli and questions were displayed); this was done so that the displayed virtual hand was 18 cm from the participants' real hand.
