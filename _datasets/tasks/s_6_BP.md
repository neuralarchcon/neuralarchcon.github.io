{% include JB/setup %}

Several different auditory/visual paradigms (including multisite SFM). These constitute the most typical paradigms for multistable perception such as ambiguous figures, binocular rivalry and others.

Battery with following tasks: 
1. Auditory Streaming (522 datasets)
2. Motion-induced blindness (1607 datasets)
3. Necker cube (530 datasets)
4. Rubin Face-Vase (312 datasets)
5. Stream/Bounce Illusion (182 datasets)
6. Structure from motion [[s_3_SFM]]

#### Detailed description

 * Approximate duration: 90 min for all 6_BP tasks
 
#### Behavioural Measures 

* Switches
* Keys Pressed
	* Proportion of time with no key (0)
	* Proportion of time with L key (-1)
	* Proportion of time with R key (1)
* RT (for Stream/Bounce Illusion)
