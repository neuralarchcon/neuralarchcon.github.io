summary: Visual short-term memory task with change detection for circular arrays of oriented rectangles. Participants detect changes between memory and probe arrays with varying set sizes (up to 32 items) and cue timing (iconic-cue, retro-cue, or post-cue), then rate perceptual clarity.

#### Detailed description

The goal of this experiment was to produce estimates of the representational limits in VSTM and we varied set size of the memory array up to 32 figures accordingly. We used simple oriented rectangles, as the capacity of VSTM tends to decrease with stimulus complexity (see below). In the basic design, subjects were asked to detect changes between a briefly presented memory array (Fig. 1a/b) and a subsequently delivered probe array. There was a change in 50% of cases, and we cued the location of the potentially changing item at different moments after presentation of the memory array. This cue (Fig. 1c) was provided either 10 ms after off-set of the memory array (iconic-cue; Fig. 1d), 1,000 ms after off-set memory array, but before on-set of the probe array (retro-cue; Fig. 1e) or 100 ms after on-set of the probe array (post-cue; Fig. 1f). To prevent that subjects used a strategy of grouping similar items together, we rotated all other items by 90 degrees between memory and probe array. When subjects did use strategy of grouping, this should lead to the general percept of change on each trial, and a corresponding decrease in performance. In addition, we manipulated strength of the positive after-image by using either white items on a black background, or red items on an isoluminant gray background (Fig. 1a/b). By using white rectangles on a black background, we recruited both rod and cone systems, and by using red rectangles on a grey background of the same luminance, we recruited the isolated cone system.
