Participants see continuously changing stimuli and have to rate in which state the stimulus was when they first saw it.
#### Detailed description

* (New task&work in progress)
* Green dot appears in the center of the screen. Participant is given an instruction to look at that dot because at an unexpected moment a line will appear on the screen. The line appears in four different directions (right, left, up or down) and then continues to get longer and longer.  
* Answer 1: Participant has to press a button as soon as the line is visible for them on the screen.
* Answer 2: the participant has to move the line back to how long it was when they first saw it. The line always has a different starting length and does not always start from zero. 
* As a last step, participant rates how confident they were that they have indicated the starting length accurately.
