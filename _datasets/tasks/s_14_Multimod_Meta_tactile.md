summary: Tactile metacognition task using non-painful electrical stimulation with confidence ratings. Participants detect or discriminate properties of electric pulses delivered to the skin and rate their confidence in perceptual decisions on a 6-point scale.

#### Detailed description

This task follows the same experimental logic as the visual and auditory metacognition tasks, adapted for the tactile/somatosensory domain using non-painful electric pulses.

* Participants receive electrical stimulation through electrodes placed on the skin. The task includes both detection blocks (was a pulse present or absent?) and discrimination blocks (comparing intensity or temporal properties of pulses).

* After each perceptual decision, participants rate their confidence on a 6-point scale. Confidence levels are indicated by visual feedback on screen (size and color of a circle). The initial size and color of the circle is determined randomly at the beginning of the confidence rating phase, to decorrelate the number of button presses and the final confidence rating.

* Stimulus intensity is calibrated for each participant using a staircase procedure to match task difficulty across participants and across sensory modalities.

* The perceptual decision and confidence rating phases are time-restricted. No feedback is delivered to subjects about their performance.

#### Behavioural Measures

* Accuracy
* RT1 (reaction time for perceptual decision)
* RT2 (reaction time for confidence rating)
* Confidence ratings
* Metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d')
