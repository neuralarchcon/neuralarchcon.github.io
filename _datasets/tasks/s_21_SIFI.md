In the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI) sound alters visual perception. Presenting a single flash with two beeps results in the perception of two flashes. It is expected that the SIFI would be influenced by experience.

#### Detailed description

* Across studies, the most commonly used parameters include a 2° white disk presented 5° below fixation for 10 ms, accompanied by two 80 dB, 3500 Hz tones presented for 10 ms each. The first tone is usually presented at the same time as the visual stimulus, or ∼23 ms prior to the visual stimulus 
* the Stimulus Onset Asynchrony between the first and the second tone systematically alters the strength of the illusion, therefore the selection of these parameters has important consequences for performance. It has recently been shown that performing the SIFI task with a confederate present can enhance the illusion: the confederate was asked to judge the number of beeps, whilst the participant judged the number of flashes. The authors attribute enhanced illusion susceptibility to the presence of a visual distractor (another person). Researchers might therefore want to consider if the experimenter or other individuals are in view at the time of SIFI assessment.
* The SIFI appears robust to spatial discrepancy between visual and auditory stimuli. SIFI effects have been observed with cross-modal separations as large as 20° and 50°.
* The SIFI has also been found, albeit with a reduced potency, using complex stimuli such as block patterns, familiar faces and buildings. Relatively less focus has been given to the effect of auditory stimulus complexity in the SIFI, therefore a consensus on this parameter has yet to be reached. For example, presenting two beeps at different frequencies has been shown to both enhance and abolish the illusion. Nevertheless, the current findings indicate that, in most cases, the SIFI persists despite changes in stimulus complexity and is therefore not bound to the simple flash and beep stimuli most commonly reported in the literature.
