Participants rated their stimuli awareness during a perceptual discrimination task. Before awareness ratings participants responded to the motor cue. Cued response could be neutral or overlapping with the stimulus-required response. Response overlapping with stimulus-required response increased stimulus awareness.

the current trial.

#### Detailed description


* The PAS was presented as a four-point scale (1–4) with the question, “How clear was your experience of the stimulus?”; the options were: ‘no experience’, ‘a brief glimpse’, ‘an almost clear experience’, and ‘a clear experience’. The meaning of the individual scale points was explained in the instruction. The description of each point was based on a guide by Sandberg and Overgaard (2015), with some modifications related to the characteristics of the stimuli that were relevant in this experiment (i.e. ‘no experience’ was associated with no experience of the Gabor stripes, but ‘a brief glimpse’ was associated with an experience of ‘something being there’ but without the ability to determine the orientation of the stripes).
* The experiment was run in a computer laboratory for four consecutive days in one-hour sessions. All trials began with a blank presentation (500 ms) followed by a fixation cross (500 ms). The grating embedded in white noise was presented for 33 ms. Participants were asked to state whether the grating was oriented towards the left or the right side (using keys “L” and “R” with their left middle and index fingers). The stimuli were Gabor gratings embodied in visual noise and oriented towards the left or right (45degrees), presented in the centre of the screen against a grey background. The visual angle of the stimuli was about 3°. The contrast of the stimuli was determined for each participant during a calibration session.
* On the first day, participants started by completing 15 training trials with feedback to get familiar with the stimuli (presented in colour in RGB space = [0.3, 0.3, 0.3] and opacity = 1). Then the staircase procedure was used to estimate the stimulus contrast that would lead to about 79% of correct discrimination responses. There were 200 trials with a 1-up 3-down staircase (stair size 0.005, limit for 0.02 and 0.08) and the contrast was established based on the last 150 trials. This was followed by 10 trials in which the PAS scale was presented before discrimination response. Participants used their right hand to report the stimulus visibility (keys 1–4). 
* Each consecutive session started with a 10-trial training session for the main task; this was followed by 300 experimental trials, which gave 900 experimental trials per participant in total. Each trial started with a central fixation point, after which the Gabor grating was presented. Afterwards participants were asked to respond to the motor cue that was presented in the centre of the screen. The cue was either a vertical bar or an arrow pointing left or right. Participants were asked to press “space” when a vertical bar appeared, “L” when an arrow pointing left was presented, and “R” for an arrow pointing right. Participants were explicitly told that this task was irrelevant to the main task and were asked to react as quickly and accurately as possible. After participants responded to a cue the PAS appeared and was used for rating; this was then followed by a discrimination task. The time limit for all responses was 3s. The outline of the procedure is presented in Fig. 1.
* After each session, participants’ accuracy in the motor cue and Gabor discrimination task was estimated so that participants with low accuracy would go through the training session again.
