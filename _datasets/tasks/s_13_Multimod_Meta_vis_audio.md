#### Detailed description

This task follows similar experimental procedures as other multimodal metacognition tasks in the battery. Participants perform simple two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) discrimination tasks in visual and auditory modalities.

* Visual stimuli: Participants discriminate properties of visual stimuli (e.g., orientation, contrast) presented with varying difficulty levels.
* Auditory stimuli: Participants discriminate properties of auditory stimuli (e.g., pitch, frequency) presented with varying difficulty levels.
* After each perceptual decision, participants rate their confidence on a 6-point scale.
* Task difficulty is calibrated using staircase procedures to maintain comparable performance across modalities.
