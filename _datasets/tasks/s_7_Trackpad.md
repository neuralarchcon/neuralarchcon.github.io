#### Detailed description

* Stimuli were red (RGBA color, 0.75, 0, 0, 1) or green (RGBA color, 0, 0.75, 0, 1) vertical gratings that drifted sideways. The gratings were formed by a sine-wave function (0.27 cycles/°), drifting sideways at 15°/s, and drawn inside a square (8° height and width), presented at fixation. The green and red stimuli always drifted leftward and rightward, respectively.
* Each trial was one of the four possible conditions resulting from a combination of first-order 2ACF response and continuous report (CR+R+; CR+R−; CR−R+; or CR−R−). Participants rated their confidence in all conditions. Thus, the task demanded that participants make a first-order 2AFC judgment in every trial, but the corresponding overt action was only present in R+ conditions.
* Example trial with both continuous report (CR+) and first-order 2AFC response. On each 5 s trial, two stimuli pairs appeared serially in four consecutive intervals. Participants pressed one of two keys for the entire duration of the trial, tracking the visual presentation (continuous report). Following stimulus offset, participants reported which of the two stimuli had the longest duration overall.
* To evaluate the effects of overt movement on metacognitive judgments, we asked for two kinds of reports. In continuous-report (CR+) trials, participants pressed two arrow keys using two fingers of their right hand to indicate which of the two colored stimuli was presented on the screen. In this condition, the task was simply to press a key that “tracked” the motion direction of the stimulus. In conditions without continuous report (CR−), participants did not press any keys during stimulus presentation. In trials with first-order 2AFC response (R+) trials, participants did a temporal-summation task. Upon stimulus offset, they indicated with a single key press which of the two motion directions had been presented for a longer period of time (i.e., which of the summed stimulus durations was the longest over the course of the entire 5 s trial). The response keys and hands used for the first-order 2AFC response were the same as for the continuous report. In conditions without the first-order 2AFC response (R−), participants were also required to make a temporal summation decision (the decision was overt in R+ trials but covert in R− trials). Each trial corresponded to one of four possible conditions, combining CR (+, present/−, absent) and R (+, present/−, absent). At the end of each trial, participants rated their confidence in their decision by moving a slider with two keys on a vertical visual analog scale with the ends marked as “very sure” and “very unsure.”
* The duration difference was determined separately for CR+ and CR− trials using two independent 1-up, 2-down staircases (updated only following R+ trials). We also ran two pre-experiment staircases of 25 trials each, without confidence ratings, to adjust the difference in duration of the two stimuli for each participant. After the staircases, each participant completed 240 trials in total (60 trials per condition). Trial types were interleaved, and the order of the trials was randomized for each participant. On any given trial, participants were not informed beforehand whether a first-order response would be required. That is, after stimulus offset, participants were either prompted to give a 2AFC on the color corresponding to the longest duration, or were directly prompted to give a confidence rating. Trials were self-paced and the experiment took on average 50 min.
* Design rationale._ As per the preregistration, we hypothesized that response-related sensorimotor activity carries information useful for confidence judgment, above and beyond the strength of the (perceptual) internal signal. We therefore expected that conditions with overt first-order 2AFC responses would be associated with better metacognitive performance than those without motor responses. In the same way, we expected that conditions in which a motor action was paired with the stimulus would also be associated with better metacognitive performance than those without motor responses.
