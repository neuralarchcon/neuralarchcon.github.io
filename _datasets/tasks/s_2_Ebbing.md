In the Ebbinghaus illusion, two physically identical central circles appear to have different perceived sizes as a result of the surrounding context of either smaller or larger circles.

#### Detailed description
* The size illusion stimulus comprised two white circles (1° diameter), a reference circle surrounded by 16 small white circles (0.2° diameter) and a test circle by seven large white circles (2° diameter), that were presented simultaneously for 500 ms on two sides of the fixation (3.85° eccentricity) with randomized spatial order. The orientation illusion stimulus comprised two circular gratings (45° orientation, 1.5° diameter, 2.5 cycles/° spatial frequency, 100% contrast), a reference grating surrounded by an annular grating (60° orientation, 4.5° diameter, 2.5 cycles/° spatial frequency, 100% contrast) and a test grating with no surround. The brightness illusion stimulus comprised two gray circles (50% luminance, 1.5° diameter), a reference circle surrounded by a white annulus (4.5° diameter) and a test circle by a black annulus (4.5° diameter).
