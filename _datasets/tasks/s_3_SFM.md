An ambiguous sphere, which could be perceived as rotating in one of two directions, was presented on each 60 sec trial. Participants reported the perceived direction of rotation continuously and the percept duration was examined.

#### Detailed description
* An ambiguous rotating sphere comprising 200 full-contrast white dots and a diameter subtending 3.5° was presented against a black background on a 17-inch LCD monitor using PsychToolbox 2 running under MATLAB. The screen resolution was 1024 × 768 pixels and the refresh rate was 60 Hz. The dots moved sinusoidally with an angular velocity of 120°/sec. A red fixation cross (.5° in height and width) was superimposed on the centre of the sphere to aid steady fixation. On each trial, the dots comprising the ambiguous rotating sphere were presented continuously for 60 sec. Participants were instructed to report the perceived direction of the rotation of the sphere by holding down one of two keys. They were also instructed not to press any key when the percept was unclear. Before the main experiment, participants were given practice trials to ensure they understood the task and instructions. Then, they completed 8 runs of trials (a total of 480 sec) for data acquisition to be used in subsequent correlation analyses.
* The experimental paradigm was identical to that used by Kanai et al. (in fact the same program was used) with one minor change: The screen refresh rate was set to 60 Hz instead of 75 Hz. As the rotation speed of the sphere was dependent on the refresh rate, this caused the angular velocity to be 120°/sec rather than 151 in the Kanai et al. study. It also meant that each trial lasted 60 sec instead of 48. In the van Loon et al. study, the sphere consisted of a higher number of dots (1850), which could be either black or white. The size of the sphere was not reported. The rotation speed was 80°/sec. As in our study, a refresh rate of 60 Hz and a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels were used. Reports of perception were obtained in the same manner as in our study.
