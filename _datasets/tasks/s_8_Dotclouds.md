#### Detailed description

Participants started each trial by clicking on a 1.2° x 3.6° box placed at the bottom of the screen. The mouse click triggered the display of a 0.1° fixation dot presented in the middle of a circular frame (3° radius) for 250 ms over a gray background, followed by the display of a random dot kinetogram (RDK). The RDK consisted of 100 dots (radius 0.1°) moving pseudo randomly at a constant speed of 3°/s. The motion direction of each dot was drawn every 16 ms from a von Mises distribution that determined both the mean (± 45° relative to the vertical) and variance of the motion direction. Visual transients at stimulus onset were smoothed using a linear ramp in contrast. On each trial, participants were asked to indicate the mean motion direction by clicking within a circular frame (radius 1.35°) located on the top, to the right or to the left of the RDK. Responses slower than 6 s were discouraged by playing a loud alarm sound. The task difficulty was adjusted by a one-up two-down staircase procedure to make the first-order performance rate converge to 71%. Perceptual evidence was defined as the inverse of variance in motion direction, increasing after one incorrect response and decreasing after two consecutive correct responses. After providing their first-order response, a visual analog scale appeared, and participants were asked to report how confident they were about it by moving a slider vertically using the mouse. The scale was presented until a response was provided, with marks between 0% (certainty that the first-order response was erroneous) and 100% (certainty that the first-order response was correct) with 5% steps. The initial position of the cursor was always 50 %. The experiment was divided into 10 blocks of 30 trials and lasted about 1 hour. The perceptual difficulty was pre-tuned to individual perceptual abilities by performing 80 trials without confidence ratings prior to the main experiment.
