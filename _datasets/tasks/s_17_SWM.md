#### Detailed description

* . Each trial started with a fixation cross (plus sign; font type, “Times”; font size, 32) that appeared for 1 s. Thereafter, 8 objects were presented arranged in an imaginary circle around the fixation cross (radius of the imaginary circle, 4.82°; size of each object, 2.41 ° x 2.41° of visual angles). Each object was placed inside a thin, black, square frame and was visible for 250 ms. After that time, only the empty frames remained on the screen; after 100 ms they were accompanied by a cue in the form of a red line pointing towards one of the frames (the cued frame also turned red). The cue and the red frame remained on the screen for 500 ms. There was a 1400 ms time interval between the cue and the frame’s disappearance and the onset of the test display.
* The manipulation was introduced at the stage of the test display. In the Image condition, participants were presented with two objects: the target object (cued in this trial) and a lure (did not appear in the memory array of a given trial). The objects were placed on the right and left sides of the display; the target position was chosen randomly for each trial. The task was to decide, by pressing the left or right arrow on the keyboard, which of the objects was the target. The Word condition differed in only one aspect: instead of presenting objects, participants were shown two labels describing the target and the lure. After the participant made the decision, they were asked to rate the visibility of the target object at the moment of its presentation in the memory array on a 4-point Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS is a standardised way of comparing visual experiences across subjects and conditions. Before the experiment, participants were instructed on the usage of this scale. After the response, there was a 1-second blank screen before the start of the next trial. The conditions were introduced as a within-subject manipulation in separate blocks (order counterbalanced across participants). 
* In total, the experiment consisted of 200 trials. Each condition consisted of 100 trials with regular breaks every 25 trials. The memory arrays were constructed so as to not duplicate any of the presented objects inside each of the 25 trials
