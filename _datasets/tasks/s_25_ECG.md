#### Detailed description

* Gabor patch orientation discrimination backward masking task. Schematic illustration of a trial flow: each trial started with a fixation cross displayed for a fixed duration of 1000 ms. Then, the target stimulus was presented for 16, 32, 48, or 64 ms and was immediately followed by the mask, which stayed on the screen until the end of the trial. Next, the subject indicated the orientation of the target stimulus by pressing the left or right arrow button on a keyboard. The T1 response-related cardiac activity was subsequently registered using ECG for 3000 ms. Finally, the visibility rating was required. The inter-trial interval lasted 3000 ms. In Experiment 2, real or fake auditory feedback about cardiac activity was delivered through headphones starting with the stimulus presentation and lasting until the Perceptual Awareness Scale appeared on the screen. In both experiments we measured baseline ECG activity before the stimulus presentation
