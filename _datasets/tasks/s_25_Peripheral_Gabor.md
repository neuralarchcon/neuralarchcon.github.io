summary: Threshold-level Gabor patch orientation discrimination task with peripheral stimulus presentation. Participants identify both the location (4AFC) and orientation (4AFC) of briefly presented Gabor patches, followed by subjective visibility ratings using the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS). Stimulus contrast is individually calibrated via staircase to achieve 70% accuracy.
participants: 117

#### Detailed description

* Target stimuli were Gabor patches with a size of 128 × 128 pixels (3.3° × 3.3° visual angle), spatial frequency of 1.5 cycles/degree, and phase of 1. The contrast was individually determined for each participant through a "1 up, 2 down" staircase procedure, aimed at achieving 70% accuracy in the identification task.

* A uniform gray background was maintained during the procedure. Each trial started with a central presentation of a white fixation cross (8 × 8 pixels). A target Gabor patch was presented for 33 ms between 2000 and 3000 ms from trial onset, with the onset chosen randomly within each trial to prevent preparatory activity.

* In each trial, the Gabor patch was presented in one of four possible orientations: horizontal (90°), vertical (0°), tilted right (45°), or tilted left (-45° rotation from vertical). The stimulus appeared in one of four possible peripheral locations: upper left, upper right, lower left, or lower right, always 2° from the central fixation cross.

* Following stimulus presentation, three response screens were presented in fixed order:
  1. **Localization task**: Participants indicated stimulus location using four arrow-marked buttons
  2. **Orientation identification task**: Participants indicated stimulus orientation using four numbered buttons
  3. **Subjective awareness rating**: Participants rated visibility using the Perceptual Awareness Scale (PAS; 1-4): 'no experience', 'a brief glimpse', 'an almost clear experience', 'a clear experience'

* Participants performed training (16 trials), staircase calibration (70 trials), and the main procedure (400 trials divided into 25 blocks of 16 trials). The entire session lasted approximately 2 hours.

* EEG was recorded using a 64-channel BioSemi ActiveTwo system at 2048 Hz sampling rate. Behavioral responses were collected via Cedrus Button Box (RB-840).
