We decided to support our multidimensional neuroarchitectural mapping by profiling the biological correlates of behavioural and neuronal characteristics. Genetics certainly play a role in the formation of the brain and its functions (Li et al., 2018) – down to the governance of activity of the individual neuron.

#### Detailed description:

**Rationale**

This is apparent from the direct impact of disruptive genetic variants in neurodevelopmental disorders as well as in genetic knock-out animal-, organoid- and cell-models. Of direct relevance to the proposed study, aggregated risk scores calculated from genome-wide association studies of brain and behavioural traits correlate with changes in behaviour, personality, and functional and structural brain parameters (see Davies et al., 2018; Alemany et al., 2019 and Shen et al., 2020 for recent examples).

**Prior Research on Consciousness-Related Cognition**

Past research demonstrated links between the aspects of cognition related to consciousness such as:
- **Attention** (e.g., Fossella et al., 2002)
- **Episodic memory** (e.g., Papassotiropoulos & Dominique, 2011)
- **Working memory** (e.g., Karlsgodt et al., 2011)

However, there is limited awareness of attempts that would examine the genetic correlates of consciousness that would be empirical in its nature (Feinberg & Mallatt, 2013).

**Approach**

The genetic data collection aims to:
- Profile biological correlates of behavioural and neuronal characteristics
- Examine genetic correlates of consciousness-related cognitive functions
- Calculate polygenic risk scores for brain and behavioural traits
- Correlate genetic variants with:
  - Behavioural performance on consciousness tasks
  - Brain structure (from MRI data)
  - Functional connectivity patterns
  - Individual differences in cognitive dimensions

#### Potential Analyses

- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- Polygenic risk score (PRS) calculations
- Gene-brain-behavior associations
- Correlations with MRI-derived structural and functional measures
- Genetic contributions to individual differences in consciousness dimensions
