          Head of the <a href="http://cfin.au.dk/cfinmindlab-labs-research-groups/perception-and-neuroarchitectural-mapping-group/">Perception and Neuroarchitectural Mapping Group</a> at the Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience at Aarhus University.

          Dr Sandberg received his PhD and postdoctoral training from Professor Morten Overgaard at Aarhus University and Professor Geraint Rees at University College London (UCL) in 2007-2010, developing/comparing subjective reports of consciousness
          and examining the neural correlates of consciousness. He was awarded the Higher Doctorate in Medicine at Aarhus University in 2019 for his subsequent work in the field of consciousness research.

        <p class="bio-text">
          Dr Sandberg and his research group at Aarhus University conduct basic as well as clinical research. A main line of research within the group focuses on human perception, particularly conscious vision. Within this line of research, they use
          magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the link between perception and brain structure/function. Their long-term aim is to build MRI based neuroarchitectural
          models that give exhaustive explanations for a range of perceptual and cognitive phenomena. In another line of research, they examine how individual neuroarchitectural models of patients with different types of brain disorders differ from
          that of healthy individuals and how these individual models explain patient outcome.
