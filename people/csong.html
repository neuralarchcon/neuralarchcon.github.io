          Dr. Song leads the <a href="https://www.braincomplexitylab.com/">Brain Complexity and Consciousness Lab</a> at Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre. Research in her lab focuses on understanding how consciousness emerges from the
          complexity of brain structure, by investigating (1) how the structure of the brain differs across individuals and leads to inter-individual differences in brain function and consciousness; (2) how sleep benefits cognition by improving brain
          structure for better functionality. From these studies, she and her team wish to understand what constitutes an optimal brain structure, and explore how that may be achieved through learning, sleep and brain plasticity.
