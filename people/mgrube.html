          Dr Grube is an independent senior scientist studying auditory cognition with a focus on time and rhythm perception in the healthy and disordered brain. She is a Neurobiologist by training, with a PhD completed at the MPI for Cognitive
          and Brain Sciences Leipzig, Germany in 2005, who has been nurturing an international research profile by working with a number of groups around Europe (UK, Germany, Belgium, Denmark) and overseas (Canada, US, India, Mexico). Her work
          integrates psychoacoustics, school projects, neuropsychology, brain imaging, and machine learning techniques into one coherent interdisciplinary line of research into perceptual timing in the human brain.
